<http://www.joke.co.uk/fun-halloween-costumes/diy-killer-colonel-costume~75561/?currency=GBP#main> <http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#description> "By following this simple step-by-step guide you too can look as terrifying as our DIY Killer Colonel. You do not need to be a professional make-up artist to achieve this look, it's so simple and almost impossible to get wrong! The base costume will be added to your basket and we have pre-selected all the items you will need to create the design in our 'Complete the Desired Look' section to the right of your screen. Un-tick the items you do not require or feel you could do without. We fully encourage using items you have around your house or free-styling with your own creativity! Talcum Powder, grass and mud are all free and by doing-it-yourself you will become an entirely unique Halloween character!\n\nCostume Includes: Jacket, Shirt Front, Trousers, Neck Tie, Wig, Eyebrows, Moustache, Goatee, Glasses, Cane.\n\nHow we did it...\nStep 1: Take the yellow feather boa and pluck the feathers off individually. This is a very easy process which took us minutes to do. Using super glue (check it can be used on fabric first) glue the feathers across the front and back of the outfit. \n\nStep 2: Add gel blood splatters across the suit.\n\nStep 3: Don't forget to add the rubber chicken to the look, he will be the Colonel's next chicken victim!\n\n\nImportant Return note:\nIf you are ordering more than one DIY costume this may cause some duplication of make-up and other items, so please ensure you amend the quantities accordingly within the basket at check-out. \nThe costume you will receive is brand new and in immaculate condition. Before you go ahead with any modifications please ensure you are happy with the fit as we will be unable to offer a refund once any changes have been made."@en .
