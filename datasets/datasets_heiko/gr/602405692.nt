Bananaman originally featured as a comic book strip in the early 80's.  A little while later the popular cartoon series was created and he is now one of the most iconic characters remembered by the child of the 80's. This is an official licensed Bananaman fancy dress costume capturing the characters unique banana-based superhero attire. \n\nCostume includes:\n\nPadded Top\nTrousers\nCape with Hood\nGloves\nBoot Tops\n\n\n This Bananaman costume includes a blue long-sleeve top with foam padded chest, deltoids, bicep and forearm muscles. The chest boasts stitching to form the shape of the abdomen muscles. There are ties at the base of the neck for easier fitting. The top benefits from professional hem finishing and an attached yellow foam belt that ties at the rear.\n\n The coordinating straight-cut blue pyjama trousers come with an elasticated waist, are a slim fit and come with complete hem finishing.\n\n The banana yellow cape comes with rear slit, an attached blue foam headpiece with large eye holes, foam ears and ties that fasten beneath the chin.\n\n Finishing touches include one pair of yellow gauntlet gloves with large foam cuffs and also one set of banana yellow foam shoe covers that are worn over your regular shoes and held in place with elastic straps.\n\n Perfect costume for a 80's themed fancy dress party. We think this Bananaman costume is simply the best of the bunch."@en .
