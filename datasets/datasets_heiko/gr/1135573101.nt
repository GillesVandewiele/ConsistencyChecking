This means that every component inside gets a generous stream of life-extending fresh air. <br>Life expectancy is a major consideration here and is among the reasons these ballasts were born magnetic. Of course magnetic ballasts deliver a bit more punch than their electronic cousins but that is only half of the story. Every component of this ballast is easily accessible and replaceable by even the least mechanically inclined. This means a lifetime of high performance and minimal down-time.<br> Instead of throwing away an electronic ballast and buying a new one, the Reeflex Cube magnetic ballast can be kept running inevitably with very little effort or expense. Maybe the best part of all is that these beauties are hand made in the USA!<br><br>* High quality components<br>* Advanced cooling architecture<br>* Strong magnetic performance<br>* A lifetime of serviceability<br>* Made in the USA<br>* Available in 150w (M81) and 250w (M80) HQI formats"@en .
