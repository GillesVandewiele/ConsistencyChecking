Riding Lawn Mower Tackles the Field or Tight Spots</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Craftsman 42 in. 19 HP riding mower</strong> blows the competition away. With its Briggs &amp; Stratton&trade; engine, this mower combines both quality and performance. Other riding mowers can be bulky and difficult to maneuver, but this mower can turn in the tightest of spaces, ensuring your entire lawn is manicured to perfection. This mower has the speed to get the job done quickly and the power to manage tougher terrain. The heavy-duty steel frame and cast iron axle is guaranteed for life, so this mower will be there for you when you need it.</p> <p>This top-notch <strong>Craftsman 42 in. riding lawn mower </strong>has several notable features, like the powerful 19 HP, 540cc engine and manual transmission for the ultimate control. With all that power and the 6 in. turning radius, this mower is a pleasure to operate. Go ahead and tackle that field; the 2.5-gallon gas tank will see you through the job. The wide cutting area, at 42 in., will ensure the task is a quick one. With the mulcher or bag sold separately, you have even more options for caring for your lawn.</p>" .
