If clippings aren't collected directly after mowing, they can build up over time, compress and prevent grass roots from receiving the right amount of water, oxygen and nutrients. In other words, if you want to keep your lawn looking its best, invest in this no-hassle, high-quality bagger built by Craftsman.</p>" .
