<http://www.osho.com/shop/en/audio-books/series-of-osho-talks/dhammapada-1/#SomeItems_583> <http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#description> "More than 2,500 years ago, Gautama the Buddha walked the earth, teaching to all who would listen. Buddhist lore has it that shortly after he passed away, his disciples met to recall all that they were able of the truths that Buddha had spoken. These sayings were complied into The Dhammapada, an anthology of 423 verses containing the essence of his principles. Osho is one of the most provocative mystics of our time, who inspires millions of people worldwide in their individual search for meditation and transformation. Through his talks on the teachings of Buddha, Osho creates a bridge from the highest peaks of human consciousness to the everyday challenges of contemporary life. Osho\u2032s focus is on a very modern-day concern: the survival of man. He describes how a Western approach to life results in a denial of the soul, reducing man to a machine, whilst the Eastern way nourishes the spiritual dimension. However, the rejection of science and of objective reality in the East has led to millions living in poverty. Up until now, man has been divided, the qualities of the scientist, the artist, and the man of religion seemingly incompatible. Osho speaks of the possibility, the necessity, of the creation of the new man, giving practical keys as to how this transformation can be brought about."@en .
