Pistol Grip Impact Wrench has Forward and Reverse Power</strong></p><p>The black <strong>Craftsman 3/8 in. impact wrench</strong> has impressive features as a professional-grade tool. It has a through-handle air exhaust to provide the torque you need at your shop or right at the job site. This tool delivers 145 ft/lbs of torque while keeping you in control the whole time with its pistol grip. It features a smooth, powerful oil bath Dynapact Hammer unit, and it has silencing technology to help minimize noise.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>Craftsman 3/8 in. pistol grip impact wrench</strong> has both forward and reverse power, so you can tighten and loosen fasteners with ease, time and time again. Combine that convenient feature with the motor-engine speed of 9000 RPM and you have a must-have for your tool collection as you build and disassemble projects. The air power tool has a 3/8 in. ratchet drive size, variable trigger speed and SCFM at 90 PSI: 6.5, as well. A one-year warranty comes with this impact wrench, for your buying protection.</p>" .
