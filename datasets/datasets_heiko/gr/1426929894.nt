The displays and interface are purposely unobtrusive. Clutter has been stripped away. Unnecessary data and icons have been removed. In taking away elements that don't add value, there's greater focus on what matters most... your dive. It's about showing you what you need to see when you want to see it. That's it. Simple.</p> <p>When we can produce such a powerful, feature-rich dive computer that you can pick up for the first time and already know how to use it, we've done our job.</p> <p>With an easy-to-use interface, amazing readability, powerful features, and simplicity at its core, the A300 CS is the new benchmark for modern dive computer design.</p> <p>The A300 CS is engineered to take full advantage of Bluetooth technologies, interacting with your dive computer before and after the dive couldn't be any easier.</p> <p>The DiverLog for iOS App makes it even easier to setup your dive computer and lets you do more after the dive than ever before:</p> <ul> <li>Get full remote control of all Dive Computer Settings.</li> <li>View Log and Profile data, add location, notes and other details.</li> <li>Share your favorites via email, Facebook(R) and more.</li> <li>Wirelessly update your A300 CS firmware on the go for the latest features and best performance.</li> </ul> <p>* DiverLog for iOS compatible with the A300 CS is scheduled for May 1, 2014. PC, Mac and Android application compatibility are also currently under development.</p> <p>\u00A0</p> <ul> <li>Ultra-bright high contrast full color OLED Display with intuitive color identification of critical dive data</li> <li>Bluetooth ready for wireless transfer of dive profiles and dive computer settings. Compatible with soon-to-be-released PC, Mac and iOS applications</li> <li>Advanced features for today's technically-savvy diver, yet comes out-of-the-box-simple for new or less frequent divers</li> <li>Powered by Dual Algorithm\u00AE allowing you to choose the decompression algorithm that best suits your diving needs without compromising safety</li> <li>Hoseless air integration with patented Air Time Remaining Algorithm provides calculations in real time, allowing accurate gas management</li> <li>3-Axis Digital Compass with Full Tilt Compensation</li> <li>Up to 4 Nitrox mixes - each with individual PO2 set points</li> <li>Automatic Safety Stop Countdown</li> <li>Optional Deep Stop with Countdown Timer</li> <li>Intuitive push button menu interface with \"Step Back\" allows for easy settings preview and edits while viewing the menus</li> <li>User Replaceable Battery with 30-40 dive hour life*. Data Retention maintains settings and calculations between battery changes</li> <li>Firmware Update Ready</li> <li>A300 CS Operating Manual</li> </ul> <p>*Battery life varies depending on several factors including display intensity setting (user adjustable on surface and underwater), water temperature and age of the battery. Use may be extended by dimming the display underwater.</p>"@en .
