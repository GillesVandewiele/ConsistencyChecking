The distance is not just one inch, but many inches. A good indicator is that the toe of the putter is elevated and the resulting stroke follows a big circle. Whether big or small, all circular putts are associated with a host of problems.<br> <br> <ul> <li>If the putter strikes the ball at the exact center of the circle, then the ball will follow the line of putt, which is the objective of the game.</li> <li>If the putter strikes the ball before it reaches the center of the circle, the ball will miss on the right.</li> <li>Alternatively, if the putter strikes the ball after passing the center of the circle, the ball misses on the left and you are stuck with an additional putt.</li> </ul> The solution is simple. Stroke the putter in a straight back and straight forward motion and the ball will follow the line of putt. Sounds good, but for most golfers implementation is not easy. The trick is to simplify the process and the pendulum like stroke. It\u2019s easy to accomplish if the eyes are directly over the ball.<br> <br> <iframe width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/kNLzUEgtUdA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"@en .
