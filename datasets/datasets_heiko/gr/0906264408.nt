They insisted on using the best materials and technology such as ultra-high resolution, 2\" velocity ribbon transducers, long-throw woofers with Kevlar cones and deformation-resistant aluminum die-cast chassis.\nOur engineers also integrated 110-Watt bi-amped technology so the B3030A could boast enormous power reserves when driven hard. To guarantee an ultra-linear frequency response, each monitor is hand-aligned and comes with an individual frequency diagram.\nBut how do they sound? Just listen!\n * Ultra-linear frequency response with individual frequency diagrams\n* Built-in 75 and 35-Watt power amplifiers with enormous power reserve\n* Ultra-high resolution, 2\u201D velocity ribbon transducer for ultimate sound reproduction\n* Long-throw 6 \u00BE\" woofer with deformation-resistant Kevlar cone and aluminum die-cast chassis for ultimate bass response\n* Controlled dispersion characteristics and extremely large \"sweet spot\" owing to the unique BEHRINGER wave guide technology\n* Active crossover network with 4th order Linkwitz-Riley filters\n* Adjustable to a wide range of acoustic conditions and subwoofer operation\n* Separately controlled limiter for low and high-frequency overload protection\n* Magnetic shielding allows placement near computer monitors\n* Delivered as \"matched pairs\" with individual frequency diagrams\n* Servo-balanced inputs with XLR and \u00BC\" TRS connectors\n* High-quality components and exceptionally rugged construction ensure long life\n* Conceived and designed by BEHRINGER Germany\n * All trademarks (except BEHRINGER, the BEHRINGER logo, JUST LISTEN and TRUTH) mentioned belong to their respective owners and are not affiliated with BEHRINGER.\n\n\u00A0" .
