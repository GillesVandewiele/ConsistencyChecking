Sweet Screams:\u00A0Fandango wants fans to scream their heads off on social media. According to ClickZ, \u201CFrom October 1 to 18, Scream-Off fans can submit videos of their best \u2018blood-curdling, skin-crawling screams\u2019 on Instagram or Twitter, with the hashtag #FandangoScreamContest and @Fandango.\u201D Fandango will pick a Scream of the Day and feature it on the site before moving it to the next round of competition. The best screamer gets a stay at the legendary Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, where\u00A0The Shining\u00A0was filmed.\n2.) IPOh!:\u00A0Late Thursday afternoon, Twitter filed its paperwork with U.S. securities regulators in hopes of being a social media IPO that really delivers. Twitter is hoping that the ever-exploding mobile market will give it a leg up on Facebook. Social media marketers can expect Twitter\u2019s decision to go public to mean a larger emphasis on advertising and mobile-friendly campaigns. But Twitter (or TWTR, as it will be known on the stock ticker) has a long way to go until it can bring in the ad bucks like Google or Facebook, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it all plays out.\n3.) Drawn Together:\u00A0Beer maker Steinlager wants its consumers to \u201Cbe the artist, not the canvas\u201D in a new spot which shows a mischievous young man who draws on his friends who have had too much to drink. The smart and funny commercial is accompanied by a \u201Cbe the artist\u201D app which gives users a chance to make and share their own ink masterpieces.\u00A0\n4.) Adstagram:\u00A0We knew it would come to this\u2026 Instagram announced this week that it would finally start delivering on the promise of introducing advertisements into U.S. feeds. Only a select group of brands that are already Instagram users will get to show ads first. The ads will slowly start appearing over the next few months. In contrast, complaints about the ads have already appeared on pretty much\u00A0every other social network.\u00A0\n5.) Bless You:\u00A0Wrapping up our list is a little slice of online video creation that perfectly mixes \u201Ceww\u201D with \u201Caww.\u201D The fine folks at Kleenex remind us not to get caught without a tissue by using people with signs telling their true sneeze confessions. It\u2019s a simple, short and very memorable spot for a brand on the verge of a hipper, lighter digital makeover.\n"@en-us .

_:node2ccc6b7c71e3439725b75a5379bbca <http://schema.org/text> "\u00A0\nSocial media experts\u00A0seemed a bit confused by Instagram when it first launched back in 2010. Would people actually care about photo sharing? Moreover, could this kind of platform really be social? And could brands find ways to make Instagram work for them? Three years later, the answer to those questions is a resounding \u201CYes!\u201D Instagram has fast become the darling of social media marketing, and a new study shows just how Fortune 500 use Instagram. Turns out, the Instagram habits of the big boys are things every company can try.\nAccording to the study\u00A0conducted by TrackMaven, the best time to post on Instagram is, well, anytime. Marketing types often think social media ends with the workday, but TrackMaven found that user activity stayed virtually the same on Instagram on weekends as it was on the weekdays. As far as filters go, Fortune 500s used #nofilter the most on their Instagram photos, but the \u201CMayfair\u201D filter performed the best. Also, Fortune 500 companies seem to be loving Instagram\u2019s\u00A0version of Vine\u00A0\u00A0new video feature. Nike, Starbucks, Foot Locker, Apple and Ralph Lauren are the top five most active Fortune 500 brands on Instagram. Yet it should be noted that while 123 of the Fortune 500 companies have Instagram accounts, only 22 percent have active accounts.\nFor small businesses who want to get better at Instagram marketing, these are fascinating things to hear and chock full of lessons. For starters, post on Instagram all day, every day. Since photo sharing often happens from events (which happen whenever), normal business hours should be happily ignored. In fact, Instagram photos posted on the weekends have a better chance of getting \u201Clikes\u201D with more folks off work and on their phones.\u00A0Also, go crazy with the hashtags. As Mashable\u2019s Jessica Lee puts it, \u201CIt\u2019s often considered a social media faux pas to use more than two hashtags in a tweet; however, on Instagram, that rule can be thrown out the window. The data prove otherwise for bigger brands, showing that four to 11 hashtags can increase up to on average 77 interactions per Instagram post.\u201D Lee also reminds us not to clog the bottom of the post with hashtags; rather, we\u2019d do well to pepper them seamlessly throughout the post instead.\nFinally, in order to have big-time rocking Instagram success, you actually have to use the darn thing! Pictures from trade shows, mouth-watering snapshots of the day\u2019s specials and exclusive backstage photos\u00A0make for great Instagram posts. Remember, the top five only became the top five because they were inspired by Instagram\u2019s endless ways to connect by sharing amazing, funny and interesting original images.\u00A0\n"@en-us .

Much of what Twitter users discuss is what\u2019s currently happening in the world and there is a lot to talk about right now. From ObamaCare and the government shutdown to new episodes of buzzed-about television shows and from football to baseball, Twitter is on fire with hashtags relating to the things we are all talking about. Used correctly, hashtags can help brands join the conversation while potentially introducing themselves to a new legion of followers.\nAt the writing of this post, the following hashtags were trending on Twitter: #TheGovernmentShutDownBecause, #Netflix, #Halloween, #Buctober and #America. If you haven\u2019t used hashtags, that list might make zero sense to you. And that\u2019s okay. Hashtags are simply ways to tag things others on Twitter are talking about \u2014 a way of joining and inviting others to join similar conversations. #TheGovernmentShutDownBecause, for example, invites Twitter users to fill in the sentence with their own one-liners, funny memes or opinions. (This one, which referenced the Nickelodeon show Drake and Josh, was the top of the pack, by the way.) But you don\u2019t have to be born in the 2000s to take part in the conversation. Hashtag #Buctober is a shout out to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team. Local brands like Pittsburgh eatery Primanti Brothers used #Buctober to encourage fans to come in after the big game. Trending hashtag #Halloween gave brands like ABC Family, American Apparel and Random House a chance to start trick-or-tweeting early with followers.\nThe key with hashtags is to strike when the iron is hot. Sometimes hashtags go on for days, but most peak in popularity in a matter of hours. Also, only use hashtags that relate to your brand and social media marketing story. If you sell cards, then #Halloween would be an easy one for you. If you sell tires, however, the hashtag of #Netflix might be a harder sell. But maybe you can make it work! For huge companies and mom-and-pop shops alike, hashtags and how we use them rely 100 percent on a brand\u2019s creativity. Hence, the sky is the limit.\nReaders, what recent hashtags have made you laugh, roll your eyes or get involved? Also, which companies rock a great hashtag?

We scooped up some of the most inspiring, most entertaining stories from the world of\u00A0online marketing\u00A0and put them on a little platter we like to call 5 Things You Might Have Missed.\u00A0\n1.) Instagram Slam:\u00A0In lieu of swirling rumors about his sexuality, actor James Franco did some of the best social media marketing of the year when he posted Perez Hilton-esque photos of himself on Instagram. The phony pictures are littered with Hilton\u2019s signature Microsoft Paint graffiti. In one fell swoop, Franco managed to take a pointed and well-deserved jab at online gossip hounds while establishing himself and his brand as an online force to be reckoned with.\n2) Hope Floats:\u00A0We enjoy a twerking fail video just as much as anyone else. But we also love when online video creation can be used to enlighten us on campaigns helping make the world a better place. This video for Hope Soap, a campaign to help kids in South Africa remember to wash their hands, does precisely that. The project distributes bars of soap to areas in need. Each bar contains a must-have toy that kids can only get to once the bar is all gone.\u00A0\n3.) The Power of 4:\u00A0Kit Kat is suddenly the coolest candy bar on the planet. Not only did the brand recently pair with Google Android, it\u2019s also come up with a mobile-centric site that has a good time making fun of smartphone and technology ads.\n4.) SMS not RIP:\u00A0If you\u2019re looking to expand your mobile marketing efforts, this piece from ReadWrite might help fire your imagination. The post says that although overall text usage is down, SMS is still an incredibly effective way for brands to reach and touch followers.\u00A0\n5.) Oodles of Doodles:\u00A0Closing out the list this week is the Doodle Project. According to the New York Egotist, \u201CThe Doodle Project is a collaborative doodle video where each frame was passed on to a different illustrator, designer or artist.\u201D The result is a mind-boggling and beautiful piece of video art that bridges the gap between design, advertising and online filmmaking.\n"@en-us .

_:nodef016ae10f3b1beaa475c9854b399d23 <http://schema.org/text> "\nJust because we love you, we promise that the following post will not, under any circumstances, make mention of Miley Cyrus, complain about iOS 7 or include Instagrammed pictures of the salad we had for lunch. Nope, our 5 Things list simply features the best stories from the worlds of\u00A0digital engagement\u00A0and online marketing that you might have missed. And really, what else do you need?\n1.) Gravity Defied:\u00A0A groundbreaking technological thriller like the new movie \u201CGravity\u201D should have an incredible website, and that it does. The site allows visitors to put on their own spacesuits like the ones George Clooney and Sandra Bullock wear in the film and try to make it back to the spaceship in an online and mobile app game. It also features that creepy music you hear in the trailers along with videos guaranteed to freak you out.\u00A0\n2.) Haunted Hilarity:\u00A0Nightmare Fear Factory, a Canadian-based haunted house attraction, is back with more funny photos of folks getting the crap scared out of themselves. For the third year in a row, the company posted shots of visitors to its haunted house in all of their freaked out and frightened glory. The shots are a viral hit every year and a perfect example of a smaller company using images on social media to really scare up new followers.\u00A0\n3.) Tweeted and Booted:\u00A0Twitter marketing rocks for back and forth with customers, but only if you\u2019re open to it. Mark Leiser of Scotland claims that UK discount airline easyJet refused to let him board after he tweeted a pointed critique of the airline. Leiser says an employee of easyJet told him, \u201CYou\u2019re not allowed to talk about easyJet like that and then expect to get on a flight.\u201D Naturally, easyJet says it would never deny boarding to a passenger based on remarks made on social media. Either way, the Twitter era continues to prove that how we respond to customer complaints has never been more important (or more visible).\u00A0\n4.) The Return of Rob:\u00A0Dior scored a triple using Twilight heart-throb Rob Pattinson in a new campaign. First, the hashtag #DiorRob has gone viral with vampire-loving people everywhere. Second, the online videos for Dior featuring the star have racked up a combined nearly 10 million total views in less than a month, making them the most popular commercial currently on the Internet. Third, #DiorRob has\u00A0single-handedly revived a men\u2019s fragrance line. Maybe Rob\u2019s popularity, like his vampire character, really will live forever?\n5.) Bad Kitty:\u00A0We wrap up this week\u2019s list with another Halloween branding story.\u00A0After blogs crucified Wal-Mart for carrying a child\u2019s Halloween costume provocatively titled \u201CNaughty Leopard,\u201D the chain has apparently pulled the item from its stores. The costume ticked off more than a few parents and feminists so Wal-Mart\u2019s move was probably a good one. Yikes. And we thought\u00A0Sexy Big Bird\u00A0was scary.\n"@en-us .
