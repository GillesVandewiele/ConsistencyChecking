A few quick points:\n\nfastIBD was run with default parameters over a dataset of 512 individuals/264,539 SNPs\nfastIBD identifies segments of relatively recent origin that are shared by individuals. These results should not be construed as measures of overall genetic similarity or origins. Rather, they suggest which populations have exchanged genes in the relative recent past, say, the last two thousand years or so.\nI included all Ashkenazi_D and North_African_Jews_D samples; of the other Dodecad and reference populations, I took random samples of 10 each; running time of fastIBD increases with the square of the number of individuals, so doing this allowed me to run this in less than a day as opposed to about a week.\n\nWith that said, you can get:\n\nSpreadsheet of numeric\u00A0results, showing sharing (in centi-Morgans, cM)\nPopulation-level graphical\u00A0results, showing an ordering of other populations based on mean IBD sharing.\n\nThe following heat map allows for a quick appraisal of populations sharing an excess of IBD sharing (read row-by-row)\n\n\n\nAnd, here are a couple of the visualizations for a few Jewish populations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that all sources of data are listed on the bottom left of the Dodecad blog.\n\n" .
