Fans of SUP enjoy the ocean sport because it's easy to learn, great for your core, and takes less balance than regular surfing. However, once you start incorporating yoga poses while on the board, things get substantially more challenging\u2026and more interesting!

Over four days, hikers will cover 40 miles of terrain following the river, with nightly wine tastings followed by lodge dinners.
