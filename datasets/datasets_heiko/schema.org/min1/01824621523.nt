It belongs in some otherhardware-related document. Better to search for an appropriate one,and get that updated as needed. I'm happy to add a link to it, though.I just don't want the LKML FAQ turning into a bloated monster thattries to answer all questions. The WWW is a *web*, not a centralrepository, and works best if we keep it a web. Links Are Good[tm].While I'm flattered you consider me (or at least the LKML FAQ) thefount of all knowledge, I really would feel better if others shared inthe burden^Wglory.\t\t\t\tRegards,\t\t\t\t\tRichard....Permanent: rgooch@atnf.csiro.auCurrent:   rgooch@ras.ucalgary.ca-To unsubscribe from this list: send the line \"unsubscribe linux-kernel\" inthe body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.orgMore majordomo info at  http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.htmlPlease read the FAQ at  http://www.tux.org/lkml/" .
