The show follows a bipolar CIA agent (Claire Danes), who suspects that a rescued prisoner of war (Damian Lewis), who has just returned to the United States, has actually become a terrorist. It is SO TENSE. You're on the edge of your seat for the whole show.\n\nWe got the first season on DVD and have been glued to it every night for the past week. It\u2019s funny when you have the dvds and can watch all the shows in a row, because it gets in your head. Usually when we go to bed, we talk about Toby or life or whatever, but now we get in bed and we\u2019re like, \"Oh my gosh! What do you think her deal is?!!! Who do you think was on the call?!!\"\n\nP.S. Claire Dane's cryface.\n\n" .
