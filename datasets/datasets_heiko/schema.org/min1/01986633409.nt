What is it? What is it? By God!\" he said, snatching at the doctor's hand as he came up.\u00A0\n\n\"It is the end,\" said the doctor. And the doctor's face was so grave as he said it that Levin took \"the end\" as meaning her death.\n\n\u00A0Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom ... Kitty's face he did not know. In the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it. He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed, feeling his heart was bursting. The awful scream never paused, it became still more awful, as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror, suddenly it ceased. Levin could not believe his ears, but there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly, \"It's over!\"\u00A0\n\nHe lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt, looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence and tried to smile, and could \u00A0not.\u00A0\n\nFalling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife's hand before his lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers responded to his kiss. And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed ... like a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature which had never existed before, and which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself, live and create its own image.\nAnna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy\n\n\n" .

But you don't have to take my word for it. \u00A0\n\n\n\nI hobbled in\nthe boot for about three weeks. Every day, the pain got a little less poignant\nand the swelling a little less colorful. At the end of these weeks, the bottom\nof my foot was still noticeably bruised, but my shin stopped throbbing whenever\nI stood up, and my ankle got downright comfortable. \n\n\n\nMy mood was\n\u2026 mercurial. My husband still listened to a lot of crying and soothed a lot of\npanicking. But I had good days, too, especially once the sun started shining\nmore and our asparagus patch started producing. \n\n\n\nIt also\nhelps that this baby I\u2019m carrying is a really good baby. This has been my\neasiest pregnancy. If I\u00A0hadn't\u00A0broken my ankle, I would have nothing to\ncomplain about. Which is probably why I needed to break my ankle? Yes, insane\nself. That must be it. \n\n\n\nMoving on:\nWe went to see the surgeon again, per the appointment made for us by the nurses\non surgery day. My X-rays looked tolerably good. Progress was progressing.\nEveryone was sort of confused about my being there.\u00A0Wasn't\u00A0I all better already?\n\n\n\n\nSurgeon: So,\nhave you been walking on that ankle without the boot?\n\n\n\nMe: No.\n\n\n\nSurgeon: You\nhaven\u2019t?\n\n\n\nMe: I was\nwaiting for permission.\n\n\n\nSurgeon:\nHuh. Well, go home and try walking on it and see what happens.\n\n\n\nMe: Like,\njust stand up and walk?\n\n\n\nSurgeon:\nYeah. And we\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\n\n\nMe: Do I\nneed special shoes or anything? \n\n\n\nSurgeon: Oh,\nwhatever (his phone rings, so \u2026) Nice seeing you.\n\n\n\nSo, I went\nhome, took off my boot, and ... yeah. I tried to walk, but it was very\nfrustrating. My entire leg felt frozen. My range of motion was embarrassingly\npoor. And with the exertion, my ankle no longer felt comfortable. It had only\nbeen kidding about that. In reality, it was both wasted and somehow so swollen\nI looked like a Cabbage Patch doll. Purple cabbage. Which was rather\nappropriate, depending on your perspective. \n\n\n\nBut, full\nsteam ahead and daum the torpedoes, right? The surgery-man had said to walk, so\nI figured I\u2019d better just do it. I went back to the crutches for a day or two,\nwhich amounted to a lot of pretending to walk. Every once in a while, I\ndouble-dog dared myself to stand up and go for it, and then I would make a\nshort trip down the hall and back, using the wall to keep myself upright. Getting\naround was possible, but for the most part I was really torturing myself. My\nbrain must have figured that since we\u00A0hadn't\u00A0been using that left foot for so\nlong, it just as well jettison any information it had stored on its function\nand purpose. Sin, man. It\u2019s bad. \n\n\n\nAfter a week\nof this, I called the surgeon\u2019s office and begged for some help. They referred\nme to a physical therapist, whom\u00A0I've\u00A0been seeing for about two weeks now. She\u2019s\nbeen immensely helpful. She\u2019s given me tools to fight back against my specific\nproblems, and she provides an objective gauge to help me see where I am\nprogressing and where I am not. Because of her efforts and the exercise program\nshe\u2019s prescribed, I can put one foot in front of the other and move under my\nown power. I am not walking normally, but I am upright and bearing all my own\nweight. Which is rather prodigious just now, so good job, stupid ankle. But,\nyou know, try harder next time.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t expect\nthings to start really normalizing until after this baby is born. For instance,\nI cannot very often fit my foot comfortably in a shoe even a whole size larger\nthan what I am used to wearing. My OB tells me that because a full 30% of my\nblood volume is being directed through my placenta, my ankle is not being\nflushed of fluids as it should be. Then there\u2019s the extra relaxin in my system.\nAnd the extra weight. And the 95-degree days. All in all, I\u2019m as barefoot and\npregnant as I can get. I still need to wear the CAM walker whenever I leave the\nhouse. And I can\u2019t yet trust my ankle to carry me up and down stairs. \n\n\n\nHowever, while\nI am still operating under an artificial light, I can finally see the sun\nshining on the other side of the curtain. The pain is gone. Any discomfort I\nhave these days is just a pitiful little band of rebel soft tissues trying for\ncontrol. We\u2019re quite safe from their friends here. The bruising is mostly gone.\nWhen I am diligent about stretching and exercising my ankle hourly, my gait is\nalmost sort-of normalish. I can make my children breakfast. I can lift my\ntoddler son into his crib at naptime. I can fetch the cinnamon off the high\ncupboard shelf. I can drive. And as this parsonage\u00A0isn't\u00A0all that big, I can\nusually catch up to people in time to stop most naughtiness. Not too bad for\nhaving broken myself a mere ten weeks ago.\n\n\n\nIn five or so\nmore weeks, this baby will be born healthy and well (God have mercy) and the\nreal healing on my ankle can get going. Even so, it will be another nine or so\nmore months until my ankle can be called reborn. About a year, then, of general\nweird living and not hiking and getting through it. But what\u2019s one year in the\ngreatest scheme of things? Christ is coming back. Come quickly, Lord Jesus.\u00A0\n\n" .

Once\npeople give up on talking you out of having so many kids, they will\nchange tactics and try to talk you out of having kids when you're old\n(unless, of course, you have no kids and are old; then it is still OK\nfor you to have a kid and actually not really OK for you not to).\u00A0\n\n\n\n\nSince we are very knowledgeable\nnowadays, the reason old people with kids should not have kids is\nthat it's dangerous for old people to have kids. All your kid making\ncomponents are rotting (and so are his, even), so you're going to\nhave rotten kids, and having a rotten kid would be really bad and\nactually even selfish and pretty much almost immoral.\n\n\n\n\nThis is basic eugenics, and we are all\nnaturally eugenicists in our own ways. It's just one of those things\nwe have to recognize and learn our way out of. Here are the basic\nlessons for dealing with this particular line of eugenic thought:\n\n\n\n\n--God puts an end date on each woman's\nfertility. When she's too old to have kids, she can't. If she can\nstill have kids, she's not too old. (I mention this just to help us\nkeep from mixing biology with ethics or morality.)\n\n\n\n\n--Every human life is worth living, no\nmatter how miserable it looks to the strong, the healthy, the gifted,\nthe intelligent, the rich. To consider another life and say that it\nis not worth its own cost is nothing but prideful condescension. This\njudgment does not happen in a vacuum. To say, \"You shouldn't\nrisk having a Down's baby\" is to look at a living person with\nDown's and say, \"There should not be another person like you.\"\nThere is only one person of whom God ever said, \"It had been\ngood for that man if he had not been born,\" and it wasn't\nbecause that man had a genetic defect.\n\n\n\n\n--There is no person so un-rightly made\nthat he does not show forth the image of God. There is no human so\npoorly endowed that she cannot receive the gift of forgiveness and\nsalvation. There is no one so ugly, so weak, so sick, or so empty\nthat he is beyond our risen Lord's power to make all things new.\n\n\n\n\n--You don't know what baby you're going\nto have until you have it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid the increased risk of genetic\nproblems or whatever other harms to which the children of older\nparents are more subject is to take the wrong gamble. So here is the\ngeneral answer I have on hand for the caring people who want to make\nsure I know there's a bigger chance now that a baby I have could have\nsomething wrong with it:\n\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for telling me about\nthat risk. I read an article about it too. If our Lord sees fit to\ngive old people like us another baby, the greatest likelihood is that that baby will be healthy and well.\"\n\n\n\n\nPractice it in your head so you can say\nit instead of what you're really thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n" .
