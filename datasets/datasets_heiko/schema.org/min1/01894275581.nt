Her goal was to have full creative control over the games she would create. Pinkerton Road\u2019s first adventure title, Moebius has been in production pretty much since the company began and is apparently coming along well. So well in fact it was just showcased at E3 with the following video;\n\u00A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00A0\nFor those who don\u2019t know Moebius is a third person Mystery Adventure game, or Point and click as it\u2019s also known. The game is being developed by Phoenix Online Studios with a musical score by Robert Holms, who composed the music for The Gabriel Knight Trilogy.\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\nIn Moebius\u00A0you play as Malachi Rector, a well travelled history expert with a photographic memory who makes a living valuing antiques for auction houses and private collections. The game begins when a mysterious government agency known as F.I S.T offers him a job. Although the assignment is far outside what he\u2019d consider normal work, it pique his interest and he accepts. What he doesn\u2019t know however is just how interested in him the government really is, and what other top-secret organisations have their eyes on him. In the beautiful city of Venice he soon finds out.\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\nI can\u2019t wait for this game, it\u2019s my most anticipated game of the year, I backed the Kickstarter campaign and have been a fan of Jane Jensen's work for as long as I\u2019ve been playing games. Moebius will be out later this year on PC, Mac, Linux and iPad, and if you\u2019d like more info check out the website. You can also rest assured that we\u2019ll be bringing you all the news about this game as it comes out. So stay tuned.\nWhat was the first game you loved?
