It blends the graceful long turn of the Katana with the smooth fade of the Wraith. It can be described as a longer Valkyrie. For newer players, the Archon is an ideal distance driver. For the skilled players, it's a great control driver. And for the power players, it's great for big S-shots and tailwind drives. It's a great choice for straight flight, tunnel shots and as a finesse disc. All in all, the Archon is a great golf disc for players looking to master their game and rule the course. It has the finesse you need when the course throws you curves. 21.2 cm diameterSpeed 11, Glide 5, Turn -2, Fade 2About Star plastic in general - it has the durability of Champion plastic with the superior all-weather grip of Pro plastic. Star discs have the same flight rating characteristics of Champion discs, although some Star Lite discs may be slightly more high-speed stable. Star retains flight characteristics longer than DX or Pro Plastics.About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Star colors.
