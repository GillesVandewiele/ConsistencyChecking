And I was \nsaying, 'Don't worry. Nobody's going to see it. It'll come and go and nobody \nwill even know \nthat we did this.'\n  \"But it just didn't work out like that. It's the weirdest thing. People \nfrom all cultures have taken to it. I think the English love Ozzy's sense of \nhumour - his dryness - and in America they like his oddness, the craziness, \neven though they \nhave no idea what Ozzy is saying.\n  \"God knows what they like about it in Japan, but they do.\" \n\n01/09/2004  13:27"@en .
