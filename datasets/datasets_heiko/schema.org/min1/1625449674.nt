Sure, they are hired to do a specific task/job, but they are that extra layer of care and security for your child while at school. These workers are carefully screened and background checked by the school district so that we all are assured that these individuals are qualified to do their job and are safe around the children. Every school I have worked within CCSD, has such workers. It is encouraging to have such individuals acknowledged publicly, as they do what they do with little notice every day, every shift. It is one important reason WHY support staff positions should not be \"privatized\" by the district. Blessings and Peace, Star " .

He had gone to pick up his date for the big dance, but the young lady\u2019s father would have no part of an unfamiliar teen dressed in sagging pants and a loose-fitting shirt. So there he was on a recent Saturday night, taking out his frustration on an exterior wall of Chaparral High School. Onlookers grimaced with each swing that bloodied the youth\u2019s knuckles. Principal Dave Wilson turned to a staff member. \u201CGo find Sam,\u201D he said. An assistant principal moved quickly. The angry student continued to pace around the outside of the high school gym, shouting, cursing, throwing jabs, mostly in the air but connecting a few times with the wall. The student\u2019s classmates were inside for the homecoming dance, oblivious to what was happening. A teacher\u2019s husband, an undercover law enforcement agent, heard the disturbance and offered help. Wilson thanked him but declined the offer. The kid needed a different style of assistance. \u201CWhere\u2019s Sam?\u201D the principal asked via two-way radio. This wasn\u2019t the first time the teenager had acted out, and dealing with him had proved difficult for others. But Sam \u2014 59-year-old Samuel White \u2014 seemed to have the magic. He was good with the kids, like a counselor. Never mind that he is the school\u2019s assistant custodian. On this night, Sam is a homecoming dance chaperon, looking sharp in a powder gray suit, a pink shirt and tie, a burgundy hat and pinkie rings serving as exclamation marks to meaty hands. Wilson wanted Sam now because, in the few weeks since the beginning of the school year, Sam had become the young man\u2019s friend, confidante and father figure. They were a memorable pair, the troubled high school student and the former Army drill sergeant and construction worker. The two were brought together by an observant school staff that was stretched thin on counselors. A year ago, Sam was the custodian at Tomiyasu Elementary School, which is attended by the children of Dave Trupp, the chief custodian at Chaparral. \u201CI\u2019d see Sam doing his job and always treating the kids like an asset rather than a liability or a problem, always treating the kids with respect,\u201D said Trupp (pronounced troop). \u201CI think it\u2019s just Sam\u2019s character. That\u2019s who he is. I\u2019ve never seen Sam be rude or malicious.\u201D He persuaded Sam to join him at Chaparral. \u201CI knew coming into a high school, you can\u2019t treat the kids without respect.\u201D Trupp spoke with Chaparral\u2019s dean of students, Scott Littlefield, who watched the recently hired day custodian interact with students. They would listen as the older gentleman offered words of encouragement, spoke of the need to dress well, speak in a clear voice, focus on schoolwork and respect others, especially women. Littlefield reached out to the lead school counselor. Meantime, the troubled young man gravitated toward Sam, drawn to his demeanor and athletic appearance. A relationship was born. The two now can be spotted riding side-by-side most afternoons on Sam\u2019s motorized work cart, picking up trash, performing some quick landscaping. The mentor shared his personal story of fathering his first child at the age of 17 and joining the Army to pay the bills. He talked of the need for education \u2014 and how he returned to school as a 52-year-old to earn his high school diploma. \u201CI\u2019m trying to instill this in the young man and let him know that it\u2019s never too late,\u201D Sam says. He stressed to the teenager the importance of personal grooming. \u201CI tell him I don\u2019t look like what I do. I come here clean,\u201D Sam says. They talk of what it means to live a moral and responsible life. Sam, on his $35,000-a-year paycheck, has bought the teen and some of his classmates shorts, T-shirts and socks. Sam isn\u2019t certain, especially after what happened on the night of the homecoming dance, what influence he is having on the teen\u2019s life. But he chooses to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for his young friend. He sees potential where others do not. \u201CI believe without a shadow of a doubt on any given day a change will come, and the change will be for the good,\u201D he said. \u201CA teacher might say he\u2019s autistic, handicapped, disabled. I say he\u2019s another man. He can do just about anything he wants to do, just like anybody else.\u201D That night, when the young man lost his cool at the school dance, Sam took him for a brief walk on a trail leading to the school\u2019s football field. They sat on the lawn, away from any passers-by. They could be seen chatting softly, the anger gone from the young man\u2019s fists. The teen was in pain because his date had fallen apart. He spoke of angry voices in his head. Sam offered some advice: \u201CDon\u2019t tell me about any voices. You\u2019re the only one in there. You have to stop and think.\u201D The two sat, talked and within 30 minutes the teen\u2019s anger was gone, fists unclenched, a smile replacing a glare.   Chaparral Chaparral High School has seen better days. Once among the top performing schools in the Clark County School District, Chaparral High is undergoing changes to counter dismal test scores and the lowest graduation rate in the district. The campus located near East Flamingo Road and U.S. 95 is one of five turnaround schools not meeting the expectations outlined in No Child Left Behind. Chaparral is now looking to clean up its reputation, touching every aspect of the school from restrooms to test scores. Changes weren\u2019t received well by students who openly protested the cuts to faculty and the new order that banned the use of cell phones and music players during the school day. Under stricter rules, tardy students are locked out of classrooms, bathroom breaks during class time aren\u2019t allowed and the lunch hour was pushed back to 1:40 p.m. Superintendent Dwight Jones told students he\u2019s not settling for half successes. \u201CRight now, 50 percent of the kids in this school don\u2019t graduate high school. Is that acceptable to you? Think about that. Right now, some of the friends that you\u2019re with aren\u2019t going to graduate. Is that OK? That\u2019s unacceptable to me. I think you guys ought to kick all of us out.\u201D  Year built: 1971 Mascot: Cowboys Principal (Year Hired): David Wilson (2011) Enrollment: Approximately 2,250 School Report Card: 2010-2011  Compiled by Gregan Wingert   3850 Annie Oakley Dr. Las Vegas,\nNV 89121  702-799-7580        " .

It reminds me so much of influences during high school rebeling against teachers etc... of all the great teachers at I had at Gorman i can only remember a couple but Gaylord and Jesse the custodians and Charles the security guard were a great positive influence during my time there. Ever grateful for the positive influence those guys had. I'm sure there's hundreds of support staff memebers in school around town that deserve the same praise as Mr. White and very glad he got his. Kudos to you Mr. White " .

This is what you lose. Not just this man, but staff members in every school in the district who go above and beyond their job description to help students in need. Walk into any school and you will find custodians, tieing shoe laces, giving good mornings and high fives and encouraging students to be the best they can be. OUT SOURCING will hurt every student in the district. " .

I know that at my school, several students graduated, not because of what the teachers did, but they connected with an adult at the school, a custodian or support staff, who mentored, encouraged, and believed. More importantly, they changed the life of that kid for the good. " .
