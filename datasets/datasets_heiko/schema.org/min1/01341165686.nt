Executive officer of the Starship USS Enterprise-D under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.\n\nRiker was born in Valdez, Alaska, on Earth in 2335. Riker's mother died when he was only 2 years old, and he was raised by his father, Kyle Riker. The elder Riker abandoned his son at age 15, an act that William held against his father until 2365 when, at age 30, father and son reunited aboard the USS Enterprise-D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Borg aren't scary anymore\n\t\tIf Dr. Seuss wrote for Star Trek\n\t\tJonathan Frakes\n\t\tStar Trek: Nemesis\n\t\n\t\tJean-Luc Picard\n\t\tStar Trek: Insurrection\n\t\tStar Trek Ranks\n\t\tDon Corleone\n\t\n\t\tDexter Remmick\n\t\tOl' Yellow Eyes is Back\n\t\tThe Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour\n\t\tWolf 359\n\t\n\t\tThe Star Trek Project\n\t\tTrue love\n\t\tConey Island\n\t\tThe Prime Directive for Dummies: A Captain's Best Friend\n\t\n\t\tartificial gravity\n\t\tUp the Long Ladder\n\t\tUSS Enterprise-D\n\t\tDeanna Troi\n\t\n\t\tStar Trek: The Next Generation\n\t\tThomas Riker\n\t\tUSS Enterprise-F\n\t\tStar Trek XI: Ailing Space Pope\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in or registerto write something here or to contact authors.\n\n"@en .
