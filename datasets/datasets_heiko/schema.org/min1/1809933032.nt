_:node1e2e28d3c1bb377d7f988172a7e62c9 <http://schema.org/articleBody> "\n    \n\n\n\n    Western Digital, a company best known for its internal and external hard drives, is entering the wireless networking market: as of today, it is offering a range of simultaneous dual-band wireless N routers. There are three basic models: the $79.99 My Net N600, which includes 4 fast Ethernet ports and 300 Mbit wireless on the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands; the $119.99 My Net 750, which gets you gigabit Ethernet as well as 450Mbit wireless on the 5GHz band; and the $179.99 My Net 950, which includes a whopping seven gigabit Ethernet ports and 450Mbit wireless on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThe real feature of interest, given Western Digital's extensive experience in both the hard drive and home NAS market, is included in the My Net N900 Central, which combines the features of the N900 router with a built-in 1TB or 2TB hard drive (for $299.99 and $349.99, respectively). Devices outside the user's home network can access files stored on these routers either through Western Digital's Web portal or the company's iOS and Android apps. The WD SmartWare software will also provide computer backup for Windows computers, while Time Machine compatibility is included for Macs.\nWestern Digital's\u00A0press release\u00A0for the routers also highlights a technology called \"FasTrack\" that prioritizes video traffic from sites like YouTube and Netflix, though most routers in this price range already offer quality of service (QoS) features that do essentially the same thing.\nThe N900 Central promises reduced cable clutter and complexity compared to existing home NAS units and USB-attached external hard drives, but otherwise these routers face an uphill battle\u2014Western Digital is entering a crowded market with competitive but not especially disruptive solutions, and the N900 model without a hard drive has an MSRP equalling that of some new 802.11ac routers. Still, the company's reputation in the storage market makes these products to watch.\n    \t\t"@en-us .
