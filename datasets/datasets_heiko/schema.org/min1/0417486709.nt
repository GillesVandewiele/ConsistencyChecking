The history, success and exposure the team enjoys brings both good and bad attention. For  every one of their twenty-four Stanley Cup banners hanging in the   rafters, there are multitudes of stories, conspiracy theories and   flat-out ridiculous rumors that float around Le Bleu, Blanc et Rouge, particularly  when the team is facing challenging circumstances (as  evidenced by the  wild controversy surrounding their choice of a  non-French speaking  interim coach or Mike Cammalleri's comments and subsequent trade). By  comparison, the Pittsburgh Penguins and their three Stanley Cup   banners have a long way to go before catching up with Les Canadiens'   on-ice history.  Yet, with the ever increasing media  swirl that has surrounded captain  Sidney Crosby's lingering concussion  recovery, the Penguins may be  gaining quickly on Montreal's media  circus. Sure there has been plenty of attention, both  local and national, paid  to Crosby's injury status.\u00A0 Why shouldn't there  be? He's the most  recognizable figure in the game.  With Crosby injury story lines drying up, a local writer found a new angle. \u00A0\nIt's  preposterous to even type such a  thing, but sadly\u2014and  stupidly\u2014there are people accusing Crosby  of skipping out on playing,  both in  the public and in the Penguins'  locker room. Ray Shero actually  felt  the need to address it Thursday,  saying, \"This is a player that's  not  medically cleared to play.\"  Let me take it further. How dare anyone question Crosby's desire, much less teammates who should know him best? ...The only thing more absurd than the notion that Crosby  doesn't  want to play hockey is that he's conspiring to get out of town. A  few, certainly not all, of Crosby's teammates are of the mind that    he's been symptom-free for a while, though they have no medical basis    for that. Some think he should be playing. Some simply think he  should   be doing more to communicate, or at least be as visible as  concussed   defenseman Kris Letang. Last week in Pittsburgh,  according to three sources, a group of   players held a 45-minute  meeting to discuss a temporary captaincy.   Another source disputed that  any such meeting occurred.\nIf  you read the entire  article, the writer suggests that Crosby is some  kind of victim of  dissension by his teammates, or as the cross-town  Pirates might put it:  The crew be plottin' a mutiny o' the Captain,  arrgh! So what makes this story worthy of Montreal-esque silliness? 1. The baseless accusation. Unnamed sources for a secret players' meeting, and a random, unspecified comment by the GM.2. The double speak. Three sources report a meeting, another source... not so much.\u00A0 What? 3. The response of \"the accused.\" The story, regardless of how silly, made it back to the locker room.The  Penguins wore a Scarlett Letter at their morning skate  practice   jerseys at BankAtlantic Center in Florida, but it wasn\u2019t an A.\nThe team all came out wearing Cs (except Evgeni Malkin, who went with the Russian K on his chest) on their sweaters to show  solidarity with captain Sidney Crosby, who skated for the first time  after the team\u2019s practice on his own.The move was also in response to an article written by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which stated: \u201Ca group of players held a 45-minute meeting to discuss a temporary captaincy.\u201DSo the Pens responded to the article by showing that they are standing behind Crosby as their captain in perpetuity.\u00A0\u201CWhen someone says we don\u2019t want Sid as our captain, it\u2019s pretty  ridiculous,\u201D forward James Neal  said. \u201CHe\u2019s an unbelievable player,  unbelievable leader. He\u2019s going to  be captain here for a lot of years.  In the room there is no doubt that  he is our leader and he is our guy...It\u2019s a pretty stupid comment.\u201D\u201CIt was just to have fun and loosen it up,\u201D defenseman Brooks Orpik   said. \u201C[Crosby\u2019s place on the team] has never been in question, not in   this room.\u00A0 People can speculate. If we are on a six-game winning streak   it probably  doesn\u2019t come up. We can only control what goes on in  here.\"\u201CSid will be our captain until he\u2019s retired. I don\u2019t know where that came from, but we had a little fun with it today.\u201DThe Penguins have won two straight after news of the  dissension  story.\u00A0 Perhaps the stir has inspired the team to chase down  their next  Cup in pursuit of Montreal's high mark, or perhaps they were  already  motivated without it. Nevertheless, one thing is certain: They are gaining quickly on the Canadiens' stranglehold on media silliness!This article is also featured on \t\t Hockey Plumber \n\n            "@en .
