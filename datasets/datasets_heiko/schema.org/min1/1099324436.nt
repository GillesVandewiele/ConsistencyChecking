McDaniels for all of the team\u2019s offensive production.\u00A0 In the last two games K.J. has averaged fourteen points per contest; that is three points off of his season average of seventeen points a game.\u00A0 McDaniels is not going through a shooting slump or turning the ball over at an increased rate, he just hasn\u2019t had to make all of the plays or take a game over because of the recent help from his teammates.\nAgainst North Carolina State, Clemson point guard Rod Hall came out aggressively by driving to the bucket and getting to the free-throw line.\u00A0 Not only did he get to the free-throw line, but he converted on every attempt taken from the charity stripe.\u00A0 He finished the game against North Carolina State six for ten from the field and eight of eight on free-throws.\u00A0 Hall also had a new career-high in points with twenty.\nHall was not the only Clemson player to provide help to McDaniels as BYU transfer, Damarcus Harrison, added fourteen points of his own.\u00A0 Harrison also shot 50 % from three and converted on all four of his free-throw attempts.\nMcDaniels was Clemson\u2019s third leading scorer against NCST with 12 points and the Tigers still managed to win by 17 points.\u00A0 Clemson also scored 70+ points for the first time in nine games when they knocked off Duke last month.\nIt was the first time Clemson has had three players score in double figures since their game in Chapel Hill against North Carolina.\nThe Tiger\u2019s game in Atlanta this past weekend against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets also had three Clemson players in double figures and the Tigers had the same end result.\nAnother encouraging sight was that it was someone else contributing on the offensive end.\u00A0 Landry Nnoko was five of eight from the field and added 13 points.\u00A0 Rod Hall did not have his best shooting game only scoring 7 points and shooting one of eight from the floor, but he did add 6 assists and did not register a single turnover.\nHarrison had another nice game offensively to carry the Tigers with 15 points of his own.\u00A0 McDaniels was again the leading scorer but the discrepancy in points between him and his teammates that we have seen all season has been non-existent in Clemson\u2019s last two contests.\nThis Clemson team has figured out what it is they need to do in order to be successful, but the main question is whether the scoring output from those on the team not named McDaniels can be consistent enough to carry the Tigers the rest of the way.\nTwitterFacebookGoogleRedditEmailPrint\n\n\tRelated\n"@en-us .
