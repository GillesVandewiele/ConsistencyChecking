Max value of deal is $2.9M.\u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 31, 2014\nRams' 1-year deal with former Titans WR Kenny Britt includes $550K guaranteed.\u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 31, 2014\n\nHe'll be reunited with former Titans coach Jeff Fisher in St. Louis. NFL Network's Bucky Brooks believes this will have an impact on the Rams draft:\nWith @STLouisRams signing Kenny Britt to a FA deal, should we scratch WR off the list of draft needs for Jeff Fisher???\u2014 Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) March 31, 2014\n\nBritt was drafted by the Titans in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft and showed some serious promise in his first couple of seasons. He topped 700 yards in each of his first two years and tallied 12 touchdowns over that span, making him a wide receiver on the rise.\nHe failed to match or build upon those efforts in the three seasons that followed, however. He hasn't had more than 600 receiving yards in a campaign since that initial success and found himself as a healthy inactive down the stretch last season.\nDespite that lack of success, he never lost confidence in himself. Jim Wyatt of The Tennessean passed along comments from Britt as the year was winding down, with the wideout saying he believed he would be a top receiver somewhere in 2014:\n\nI am going to be a No. 1 receiver somewhere else if I am not here next year, and that is guaranteed. I am definitely going to be a receiver that makes plays on Sundays and makes something happen for a team.\n\nTeresa Walker of The Associated Press also noted that Britt continued to support the team even though he was scratched in the latter stages of the season:\nGive Kenny Britt some credit. No sulking being scratched again by #Titans. He's cheering his teammates on sideline.\u2014 Teresa Walker (@TeresaMWalker) December 29, 2013\n\nConfidence in himself and showing a team-first attitude on the sidelines are both positive signs, but they don't guarantee a bounce-back year in 2014. It all comes down to playing consistently so he can be relied on week in and week out.\nWyatt passed along word that the Titans weren't looking to bring Britt back once he hit the open market:\nThe #Titans have no plans to re-sign WR Kenny Britt. This shouldn't come as a surprise\u2014 Jim Wyatt (@jwyattsports) February 21, 2014\n\n\n  \n    Will Britt bounce back in 2014?\n    \n      \n                              \n              \n              Yes, he will make a big impact.\n            \n                                        \n              \n              No, he's not a reliable option.\n            \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n        Submit Vote\n        vote to see results\n        \n\n                \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n        Will Britt bounce back in 2014?\n                              \n              Yes, he will make a big impact.\n              \n                77.6%\n                \n              \n            \n                                        \n              No, he's not a reliable option.\n              \n                22.4%\n                \n              \n            \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n        Total votes: 4,576\n      \n    \n\n          \n        if (!BR.PollData) {\n          BR.PollData = {};\n        }\n\n        if (!BR.PollData[307087]) {\n          BR.PollData[307087] = {\n            id: 307087,\n            question: \"Will Britt bounce back in 2014?\",\n            choices: {\"choice9\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice4\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice5\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice0\":{\"count\":3552,\"choice\":\"Yes, he will make a big impact.\"},\"choice6\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice1\":{\"count\":1024,\"choice\":\"No, he's not a reliable option.\"},\"choice7\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice2\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice8\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"},\"choice3\":{\"count\":0,\"choice\":\"\"}},\n            sidebar: false\n          };\n        }\n\n        if (BR.poll) {\n          BR.poll.showResults(307087, false);\n        }\n      \n      \nAfter the initial wave of free agency, Britt quietly generated some interest from a few teams, including the Buffalo Bills and Carolina Panthers, according to his agent Pat Dye Jr., via Fox Sports' Alex Marvez.\nUltimately, a change of scenery was probably Britt's best bet. He had fallen out of favor in Tennessee and now has a chance to revitalize his career with a new team, which took a flyer on him based on that initial success under its current head coach.\nTurning into the true No. 1 receiver he predicted is very much a long shot. There's no reason he can't become a solid No. 2 option, though, behind Tavon Austin. At just 25 years of age and with good size (6'3\", 223 pounds), he still offers plenty of potential.\nAs long as he's able to cut down on the drops, this talented wideout could still make an impact. After showing a lot of upside early in his career, Britt must now prove himself once again.\n\u00A0\n\n\n            "@en .
