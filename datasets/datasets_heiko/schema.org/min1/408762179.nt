Above all else, we prepare Students for productive and meaningful lives.\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF\n\nWHAT\u2019S IN A NAME?\nThe official school name is the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga which is the proper usage in first reference to the athletics program. The appropriate short form is simply Chattanooga with the abbreviated form of UTC. \u201CChatt\u201D is acceptable as a leaderboard moniker. There is no hyphenated form of the school name (i.e. UTChattanooga, Tennessee-Chattanooga, Tenn.-Chatt., UT Chattanooga, etc.). The nickname is simply Mocs. For more information and current athletic marks, turn to page 14.\n\nNO. 1 IN THE NATION\nThe Chattanooga Mocs men\u2019s golf team has twice been ranked No. 1 in the nation by Golfstat. Both occurences came in fall rankings in 2008 and 2009. In both cases, the Mocs started strong at the Carpet Capital Collegiate Classic with a win in 2008 and runner-up in 2009.\n\nFORMER MOCS IN PROFESSIONAL GOLF\nAmong the numerous golfing alums of the University, there are several in the world of professional golf. Jonathan Hodge (\u201810) earned his Web.com Tour card in December 2012 at PGA Tour Q School. Stephan Jaeger (\u201812) also reached the final stage of Q School and has Web.com Tour status for 2013. Jaeger and recent grads Bryce Ledford (\u201807), Derek Rende (\u201810) and Tripp Harris (\u201810) are also working their way up through the myriad of tours (e.g. NGA/Hooters, eGolf, Canadian, etc.). Kip Henley (\u201882) was the winner of the Golf Channel\u2019s Big Break II and recently caddied for PGA Tour pro Brian Gay.\n\nGoMocs @GoMocsMGLF\n\n1\n\n\n\u000CSOUTHERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS: 1987 \u2022 2007 \u2022 2008 \u2022 2009 \u2022 2012\n\nFACILITIES\n\nPLAYER DEVELOPMENT COMPLEX\nPlayer Development Complex Quick Facts\nTotal Area: 28 Acres.

UTC student-athletes, coaches and staff logged over 1,800 hours volunteering in the community over the last year at events such as canned food drives, the Freshman Move-In, Bloodanooga, Clean and Green and Read Across America. The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) plans many of the Athletic Department\u2019s community events. The Mocs have a presence at Chattanooga\u2019s Special Olympics events each year. UTC student-athletes also host many events that engage the local community, such as the 2012 Southern Scuffle.\n\nSOCIALLY\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF\n\nMembers M emb bers of f the the M th Mocs ocs wrestli wrestling tling t team eam h helped elp l ed d out t at t th the eR Ronald ld McDonald M D ld Th The L Lady ad dy Mocs Mocs hosted host ted d their thei th ir second-annual second d annual l Gi G Girls irl ls Scout S Scouts ts S Sports-A-Thon ports t A Th Thon iin House Move-In Day.

A new direction for the athletics identity was determined, moving away from the politically incorrect Native American Indian imagery. Several identities have been used in the past. With the old nickname \u201CMoccasins,\u201D a snake was used in the 1920s and an Indian was used until the year of major change in 1996. A moccasin shoe was even used in the 1980s. In 1996, it was decided to adopt the State Bird of Tennessee, the Mockingbird, as the core of the new identity, while incorporating the strong regional imagery of Chattanooga\u2019s vast railroad history. The mascot \u201CScrappy\u201D was born and a new emphasis was placed on the athletics department\u2019s role in the region. The committee also recognized the need for the word \u201CChattanooga\u201D to have a great emphasis in the logo. The nickname \u201CMoccasins\u201D was shortened to simply \u201CMocs\u201D. Thus established, Chattanooga could rebuild its athletics programs and initiatives around this new identity. And rebuild it did. Quickly establishing the identity program in February 1997, combined with tremendous success in the NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament, UTC had positioned itself to reach for the next level. From 1997 to 2007, the primary logo was the mascot, Scrappy, riding a train. The secondary logo features the front of a train with the word Mocs built into the logo. This logo is affectionately called the \u201CCowcatcher logo,\u201D referring to the front lower grill of the train that helped push objects from the train tracks. In August 2007, officials at Chattanooga updated the school\u2019s marks. A new C logo, the \u201CPower C\u201D as it has become known to fans and alums, was created as the primary mark and is emblazoned on the side of the football team\u2019s helmets. The secondary marks were updated with a more modern look, and a new font, unique to the school, is now used on the text areas of the logos and marks. In September 2008, Scrappy was re-branded to better match the image of a mockingbird and reflect the rich tradition of our state, our city and our University. New marks of the head as well as a full body were released. The program has also been taking special efforts to stay true to its color palette\u2014which includes navy blue and old gold.\n\nTHE ANSWER\nFor more than a decade, this question has puzzled many fans and observers of Chattanooga Athletics. The UTC Athletics Department changed logos in 1997, moving away from Native American imagery to a package of logos using railroad images, the nickname \u201CMocs\u201D and the Scrappy mascot. The new package emphasized UTC\u2019s connection to Chattanooga and the city\u2019s railroad heritage and incorporated the Tennessee state bird. The term \u201CMoc\u201D is short for \u201CMockingbird.\u201D Mockingbirds are fiercely territorial creatures which protect their homes with courage, determination and skill. Those attributes reflect the intellect, spirit and character of UTC student-athletes and alumni. A Moc is a champion on the playing surface, in the classroom and, most importantly, in life.\n\nSCRAPPY\nNamed after legendary football coach A.C. \u201CScrappy\u201D Moore, Scrappy, the Chattanooga mascot, is a fixture for the Mocs. A re-design in 2008 puts Scrappy in the image of the State Bird of Tennessee, the Mockingbird. The mockingbird is known as a fierce protector of its nest and environment. It is sometimes seen swooping down on a dog, cat or predator that may be venturing too close to the bird\u2019s protected territory. Once described by \u201CLate Night\u201D host Jimmy Fallon as \u201Ca sledge-hammer wielding mockingbird with a heart of Blue & Gold,\u201D Scrappy symbolizes that competitive passion.\n\nThe \u201CPower C\u201D is the primary mark of the Chattanooga athletics department. It can be used alone or with \u201CCHATTANOOGA MOCS\u201D in the school\u2019s custom-made font below the C.\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF 14\n\nSecondary Athletics Marks:\n\n\n\u000CNCAA REGIONAL: 2007-12 \u2022 CHAMPS 2012 \u2022 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP: 2009, 2012\n\n2012-13 MOCS\nROSTER INFORMATION\nSite Dalton, Ga.

He has a spearheaded a consistent presence in the national rankings. s His impact is not just felt in one area of the program. The squad has excelled in each aspect of the UTC Athletics Mission s Statement which is to \u201Cguide, encourage and support our S Student-Athletes in their quest for comprehensive excellence S - academically, athletically and socially. Above all else, we prepare Students for productive and meaningful lives.\u201D p With 16 team and 12 individual wins, a strong academic achievement record and a solid presence in the community, a iit\u2019s t easy to see his commitment to establishing comprehensive excellence as the UTC standard. ATHLETICALLY During Guhne\u2019s tenure, the Mocs have been ranked No. 1 in the nation twice and won a NCAA Regional. Enough said? Not hardly. In 2012, four different individuals won five events \u2013 two collegiate. It included NCAA Regional and SoCon Championships by Stephan Jaeger and two Scottish summer titles: Tennant Cup (Liam Johnston) and North East Open (Chris Robb). Oh and Steven Fox captured the United States Amateur. Four of Chattanooga\u2019s five Southern Conference Championships have been under his guidance, winning in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012. His charges not only swept team and medalist honors at the 2012 SoCon Championship, but they followed it up with an epic sweep at the NCAA Bowling Green Regional coming from behind to beat the likes of UCLA, Texas A&M, Arkansas and Clemson. Six of his seven teams have advance to NCAA Regional play. Twice, 2009 and 2012, the Mocs moved on to compete in the NCAA Championship finishing 18th both times at Inverness in 2009 and Riviera Country Club in 2012. He has recruited and helped develop two All-Americans. Jaeger is the most recent, earning first team honors in 2012, while former teammate Jonathan Hodge made the second team in 2008. Guhne has mentored five of the last six SoCon Golfers of the Year in Hodge and Jaeger. Hodge won the award in 2007 and 2008, while Jaeger is the only student-athlete in league history to win it three times. Jaeger is the jewel of the Guhne years as the most decorated student-athlete in the program\u2019s history. He holds virtually every tournament, season and career record of note. His four career wins along with Hodge (3) rank 1-2 among the all-time leaders. But the program was not built on just two student-athletes. Six different golfers have wins under Guhne, accounting for 12 overall. The team\u2019s 16 overall wins include five postseason. The big regular season victory came just down the road at The Farm in Rocky Face, Ga., as Guhne\u2019s Mocs won the prestigious Carpet Capital Collegiate Classic, in 2008. That win spurred the first No. 1 ranking in school history. The second came a year later in 2009. The top final team ranking is No. 12 (Golfweek/Sagarin Performance Index) in 2008 with another top 25 in 2009 (No. 25). The 2012 team just missed out, ending up No. 27 on Golfstat. That 2007-08 team had a remarkable year in earning the No. 12 final ranking. It won a program-record five times with three medalist honors by Hodge, another school record later tied by Jaeger in 2012. Guhne has four SoCon Coach of the Year awards - 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012 - in his seven seasons with the top ranked team in the league over the last six. He was also named 2009 Eaton/Golf Pride East Region Coach of the Year. He\u2019s had 10 PING All-East Region selections highlighted by Jaeger\u2019s four appearances and Derek Rende\u2019s three. Those two are four-time All-SoCon selections which accounts for eight of Guhne\u2019s 19 all-league members. The 2011-12 team will be long remembered for the postseason title run as well as the remarkable effort by Jaeger. His three wins tied Hodge\u2019s season record and his 22-under par total for the season led to first team All-American honors. Fox offered on of the top highlights of the campaign. His second round 64 (-8) set the course record at the Club at Olde Stone at the Bowling Green Regional. Jaeger became the first Mocs golfer since Donnie Green in 1978 to win the SoCon\n\nGuhne with 2012 U.S. Amateur Champion Steven Fox\n\nChampionship and did so by tying Brad Faxon\u2019s (Furman) record for margin of victory (11 shots). He also set the school 54-hole record shooting 13-under par 203 in winning the NCAA Bowling Green Regional. Guhne\u2019s had several individuals ranked among the nation\u2019s leaders year-in and year-out. Jaeger ended the 2012 season ranked No. 12 in the Golfweek/Sagarin Performance Index which is another program best for the German. Hodge\u2019s No. 26 in 2008 is second to Jaeger, but it is also the only time the Mocs have had three top 100 performers in the same season. Rende (74) and Fredrik Qvicker (88) joined Hodge as the squad boasted four All-Southern Conference performers with that trio and Ben Rickett. Guhne\u2019s 2010-11 squad showcased his ability to continue moving the program forward. His No. 1-ranked squads did so with a remarkably similar roster. This one followed those years with just one junior (Jaeger) and a sophomore (Fox) to go with three freshmen in the lineup. That group had the fewest losses in Guhne\u2019s six seasons with just 41 in 11 events. The young squad had many memorable moments. They knocked off three top 15 programs in national runnerup Georgia, Stanford and Iowa in a week\u2019s time finishing second at the Linger Longer and LSU National Invites to Alabama and LSU, respectively. As part of the growth of the student-athlete, Guhne encourages aggressive summer tournament schedules. During his tenure, five players have qualified for the U.S. Amateur, three in 2007 in Hodge, Rende and Bryce Ledford. Jaeger qualified in 2011 and Fox won it in 2012. Qvicker finished as low amateur at the 2007 Scandanavian Masters, while Rickett qualified for the 2007 English Amateur, finishing in the final 16, and the 2008 British and English Ams. Rickett, Qvicker and Jaeger all advanced to match play at the Amateur together in 2009. Rende won the 2007 Tennessee State Open and then followed in 2008 with a win at the Tennessee State Amateur. Hodge qualified for the Western Refining All-American in 2008 and played a phenomenal summer schedule which included a third-round finish at the North/South Amateur. Jaeger was a wild-card entry in the 2011 BMW International Open on the European Tour. Fox won the 2011 Tennessee Match Play Championship. He made a run at the 2009 Tennessee Open title finishing tied for second to Ledford and was a semi-finalist at the 2010 Match Play Championship. He and incoming freshman Kory Webb won their qualifiers for the 2012 U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship. ACADEMICALLY Chattanooga\u2019s men\u2019s golf team takes the term student-athlete to heart. The team yearly posts one of the athletic department\u2019s top team GPA\u2019s and in 2012 received national notice. The squad achieved a perfect multi-year APR score of 1,000 for the period 2008-11. It became the first program in UTC history to attain the mark over a four-year period. While maintaining eligibility and graduating is important in athletics, the Mocs have excelled in the classroom. Every student-athlete that Guhne has brought to Chattanooga and completed eligibility has graduated. During the 2008-11 time period, the Mocs had two All-America scholars in Jaeger and Rende along with multiple Academic All-SoCon, Dean\u2019s List and Athletic Director\u2019s Honor Roll mentions. The team\u2019s commitment to the classroom mirrors its play on the course.\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF 16\n\n\n\u000CNCAA REGIONAL: 2007-12 \u2022 CHAMPS 2012 \u2022 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP: 2009, 2012\n\nMARK GUHNE\n4-TIME SOCON COACH OF THE YEAR\nTies 1 2 4 1 1 3 0 12 Titles 1 4 5 3 1 0 2 16 COACHING RECORD Years Wins 2005-06 105 2006-07 149 2007-08 158 2008-09 101 2009-10 113 2010-11 107 2011-12 112 Totals 845 Losses 56 50 42 77 64 41 56 386 HONORS SoCon Coach of the Year: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012 Eaton/Golf Pride East Region Coach of the Year: 2009 NCAA APPEARANCES REGIONALS: 2007 East, 2008 East, 2009 South Central, 2010 Southwest, 2011 Colorado, 2012 Bowling Green (Won) CHAMPIONSHIP: 2009, 2012 TEAM TITLES 2005-06: Re/Max UTC Fall Cl. 2006-07: Rio Pinar Int., Wexford Int., USA Spring Classic, SoCon Champ. 2007-08: Coca-Cola Duke Golf Cl., Cleveland Palmetto Int., Furman Int., Bank of America Int., SoCon Champ. 2008-09: Aldila Scenic City Inv., Carpet Capital Coll., SoCon Champ. 2009-10: Cleveland Golf Palmetto Int. 2011-12: SoCon Champ., NCAA Bowling Green Regional INDIVIDUAL MEDALISTS 2005-06: Bryce Ledford, Re/Max UTC Fall Cl. 2006-07: Derek Rende, USA Spring Cl. 2007-08: Jonathan Hodge, Coca-Cola Duke Golf Cl., Cleveland Palmetto Int., Furman Int. 2009-10: Steven Fox, Furman Int.

Integrity:\nWe can be counted upon to \u2018do the right thing.\u2019\n\nATHLETICALLY\n\u2022 Three teams won SoCon titles in 2011-12, wrestling, men\u2019s golf and women\u2019s golf. Six teams - women\u2019s basketball (WNIT), men\u2019s and women\u2019s cross country, wrestling and men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf competed in postseason play. \u2022 Individually, the Mocs had three All-Americans, two SoCon Athletes of the Year, seven SoCon Champions, three SoCon Freshmen of the Year and one SoCon Coach of the Year.

Not to forget their closest fans, the studentathletes again took part in Operation Move-In, helping freshmen unload into their dorms to begin the fall semester. \u2022 Being engaged in the community can extend past volunteering. The Mocs created a stir with a number of creative marketing ideas, including the Go Blue Be Gold football game against Jacksonville State , the Black Out men\u2019s basketball game against UNCG, Phillip D. Glass donning a football helmet for the second year in a row and having the No. 2 rated football media guide in the nation.\n\nContinuous Improvement:\nWe are always learning and seeking a \u2018better way.\u2019\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF\n\nFOR ALL FANS OF MOCS ATHLETICS & MOCS CLUB MEMBERS\nThe University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Athletics Department considers total compliance with NCAA and Southern Conference rules to be one of the highest priorities of our institution.

The SoCon is the nation\u2019s fifth-oldest NCAA Division I collegiate athletic association. Only the Big Ten (1896), the Missouri Valley (1907), the Pacific 10 (1915) and the Southwestern Athletic (1920) conferences are older in terms of origination. Academic excellence has been a major part of the SoCon\u2019s tradition. League athletes have been recognized countless times on Verizon/CoSIDA Academic All-America and district teams. A total of 19 Rhodes Scholarship winners have been selected from conference institutions. The SoCon has sent three schools to regionals in three of the last six years with the Mocs leading the charge in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and with multiple individual berths including Emma de Groot in 2008. A SoCon school has qualified for the NCAA Championship four times since the turn of the century with the Mocs being the most recent entry in 2009. The Southern Conference office is located in the historic Beaumont Mill in Spartanburg, S.C. A textile mill that was in operation from 1880 until 1999, the Beaumont Mill was renovated in 2004 and today offers the SoCon a first-class meeting area and offices as well as a spacious library for storage of the conference\u2019s historical documents.\n\n2012-13 MEN\u2019S GOLF\n\nAppalachian State Mountaineers\n\nCollege of Charleston Cougars\n\nChattanooga Mocs\n\nThe Citadel Bulldogs\n\nDavidson Wildcats\n\nElon Phoenix\n\nFurman Paladins\n\nGeorgia Southern Eagles\n\nUNC Greensboro Spartans\n\nSamford Bulldogs\n\nWestern Carolina Catamounts\n\nWofford Terriers\n\n43\n\n\n\u000CSOUTHERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS: 1987 \u2022 2007 \u2022 2008 \u2022 2009 \u2022 2012\n\nMOCS MEDIA\nFOLLOW THE CHATTANOOGA MOCS ONLINE\nNow you can keep up with all the latest Chattanooga Mocs news on Facebook and Twitter.
