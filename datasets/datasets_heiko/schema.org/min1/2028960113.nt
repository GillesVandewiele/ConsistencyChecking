Who gives a f**k about what they like?\u201D \u2013 Public Enemy\nKendrick Lamar got screwed: simple and plain.\nNobody should be shocked, because the Grammy game as always been a tricky beast when it comes to Hip-Hop. Way back in 1988 (a seminal year for Hip-Hop), Hip-Hop heads like Will Smith, Salt N Pepa and Public Enemy publicly boycotted the award show because they didn\u2019t televise the Hip-Hop portion. Rappers don\u2019t have such solidarity in 2014, but Jay Z did voice his discontent in other ways. Nevertheless, if Kendrick is feeling a way about not winning any of the Grammys he was nominated for, he should rest assured that he\u2019s in the company of true Greats. Below is a list of some of the big names and talented artists that never took home what Jay Z called a \u201Czippy cup\u201D to their home.\nTupac Shakur\nBob Marley\nSnoop Dogg\nJimi Hendrix\nDiana Ross\nNas\nChuck Berry (The creator of Rock-N-Roll music)\nNotorious B.I.G.\nRun DMC\nPublic Enemy\nDMX\nNWA\nIce Cube\nDrake\nBjork\nBusta Rhymes\nThe Who\nJourney\nThe Doors\nLed Zepplin\nDepeche Mode\nGuns N\u2019 Roses\nKiss\nMorrissey\nKaty Perry\nCat Stevens\nFlorence\u00A0+ the Machine\nStevie Nicks\nMartina McBride\nAnd there are more\u2026but this is a sample of many.\nShare |Share on FacebookClick to share on TwitterClick to share on RedditClick to share on PinterestMoreClick to share on LinkedInClick to email this to a friend\n\n\tRelated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"@en .
