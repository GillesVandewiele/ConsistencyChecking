Fresh \nBrothers had been on my list for Southern California and it just so happens \nthat my last trip to that area led me right into their restaurant. It's \nmore of a take-out pizzeria, however they had some limited seating, and \nlots of TVs if you were looking to watch the local game. The menus are at \nthe counter and they have a full nicely color printed gluten-free menu for \nsalads and pizzas and even some desserts although I didn't leave room for \ndessert.\n\nThe gluten-free pizza comes in personal pan size, medium, and large. I went \nwith a personal pan because it reminded me my days of the book reading club \nat Pizza Hut (if you don't know what I'm talking about please disregard). \nIn any case I got the small pizza which was four slices with extra extra \ncheese artichokes and bacon and it was delicious. With a small soda my \npizza cost me $12. Is that pricy? Not sure. It was good and if I lived in \nthe area I would certainly go back. I don't know about the kitchen \nsituation; if the pizza crust was made in house or made at local bakery But \nI didn't get sick which is always a plus when you're on vacation. If we had \nbeen in the area longer I think it would've had some delivered to our hotel \nroom. This pizza also made a great cold breakfast.\n\n\u00A0"@en-us .
