The Bayou Bengals are currently tied with The University of Miami for the most active players in the league.  \n\nLSU fans can recall all of the greats that have left Baton Rouge for the NFL, but I\u2019ve compiled the greatest Tiger players currently playing.  These players have in my opinion had the greatest careers of all of the active LSU players to this point.  \n\nWhile many have come before them and I am sure many are still to come, these players have carried on the passion of Tiger football and brought success to their NFL teams. \n\n            "@en .

He led the team with 136 tackles and five sacks and was named Parade High School All-American. \n\nHe joined forces with Trev Faulk and the two dominated at linebacker at LSU. \nJames is only the second player in LSU history to have 400 tackles and in his final season in Baton Rouge, became the first Tiger to have 150 tackles in a single season.  The team captain also added three sacks and an interception on his way to becoming an All-American.\n\nDrafted by the Dallas Cowboys, James still remains a dominant force at linebacker.  Though he has no Super Bowls or Pro Bowls to his name, Bradie James is highly respected as one of the top defensive players in the NFL.\n\n            "@en .

The Indianapolis Colts were not blind however and drafted Addai in the late first round where he quickly replaced Edgerin James in the starting lineup.\n\nAddai has had a solid NFL career, with a Super Bowl and a Pro Bowl under his belt.\n\n            "@en .

Mawae says he is proud of this accomplishment because he believes that it shows that he plays the game hard, but admits that it has cost him both physically and monetarily. \n\n            "@en .

Tiger fans may remember the famous \u201CAll eyes on three\u201D motto and swagger that the running back brought to the team.\n  \nKevin Faulk finished his college career with 4,557 rushing yards, second only Hershel Walker in the SEC.  Faulk rushed for 200 yards in a game four times in his career, including a school record 246 against Houston his freshman season.  \n\nFaulk was an LSU great, holding many school and SEC records, but his career in the NFL has been even more successful.  \n\nFaulk is not the superstar in New England that he was in Baton Rouge, but his toughness and relentless work ethic have made him one of the most important Patriot players over the last decade.  He always steps up when needed and does whatever the team asks of him.   \n\nFor this reason, Faulk and the Patriots have three World Championships since he was drafted in the second round in 1999.\n\n            "@en .
