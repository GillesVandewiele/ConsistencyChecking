Brock Lesnar pretty much made very short work of Frank Mir. So I find myself sitting here wondering who is going to pose a threat to this Huge monster? Frank Mir was thought to be a guy who would at least give Brock a run for his money, but once again Brock's strength and wrestling skills where just too much for his opponent. So since he pretty much has ran threw Frank Mir it just really leaves me wondering.\nHowever, here's what I do think. I think that Shane Carwin is for sure a possible threat to Brock Lesnar at this point. He wouldn't be giving up too much size, plus we have all seen what a good chin Shane Carwin has after watching him take a few hard shots from  Gabriel Gonzaga. \u00A0\nWe also for sure cannot leave Cain Velasquez out of the picture because after his great performance against Cheick Kongo, I think he has  proved\u00A0that he is going to be one of the big guns in the  Heavyweight division.\u00A0\nI know I am looking  forward to the Cain vs. Carwin fight that's coming up. The winner of that fight will be the guy that I think has the best shot at actually taking Brock Lesnar out.\nThis is my first ever article guys so cut me some slack. Plus keep in mind I wrote it in a total of about 10 mins...right before bed. Anyways, tell me what you guys think :)\n\n            "@en .
