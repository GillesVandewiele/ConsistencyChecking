The government agencies argued that it is a crime to use, mutilate, or alter a government seal without permission. (The site has now switched over to CafePress.)\nOn Tuesday LibertyManiacs owner Dan McCall\u00A0sued those agencies, arguing that he has a First Amendment right to parody the DHS, the NSA, and other government offices, and that he should be allowed to use the relevant seals.\n\u201CThe agencies\u2019 attempts to forbid McCall from displaying and selling his merchandise are inconsistent with the First Amendment,\u201D said Paul Alan Levy, the Public Citizen attorney handling the case, in a statement. \u201CIt\u2019s bad enough that these agencies have us under constant surveillance; forbidding citizens from criticizing them is beyond the pale.\u201D\nLevy is a well-known, high-profile First Amendment lawyer, having recently defended a California man who maintained a website satirizing embattled Arizona lawyer Charles Carreon.\nPublic Citizen is representing McCall in his suit against those government agencies, and it is asking a federal court to declare that these federal laws are unconstitutional on the grounds that they violate the First Amendment.\nNeither the DHS nor the NSA responded to Ars\u2019 request for comment.\n    \t\t"@en-us .
