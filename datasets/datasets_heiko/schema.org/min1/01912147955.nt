_:node1965145ecc32fc71a9c964224eb69d9 <http://schema.org/articleBody> "\n                        It\u2019s safe to say that some eight years and two generations of Cayenne later, this high-powered sports-car-like SUV from Porsche is no longer an anomaly. In fact, as it has sold just shy of 60,000 units in 2011 alone, it\u2019s probably OK to call it a Porsche portfolio mainstay. So I can see why it\u2019s smart to keep the brand fresh and offer up the unique and trendy packages that customers of an SUV like this want. The latest Cayenne is the second release of a GTS model, shown earlier this year at the Beijing auto show. Sliding in between the 400-horsepower V8 version and the V8 turbo top-of-the-line Cayenne, the new GTS tweaks the V8\u2019s performance by coaxing another 20 hp out of the big block. Looks-wise, the subtle yet unmistakable changes of a blacked-out fascia and wheel components of the GTS will make it instantly recognizable \u2014 and it looks badass.The first-generation GTS sold 15,766 units or 17% of total Cayenne sales; that\u2019s a good enough reason to follow it up with a second-generation GTS. However, this time, the SUV\u2019s character does take a darker turn. And it is changed (if only slightly) body-wise. The body is lowered by 24 millimetres and the rear track is widened by 17 mm, while the front axle grows by 13 mm.Special side skirts and wider wheel arches (all in the body colour) shape the side view, while the window frames are painted high-gloss black. But one of the key elements that grabs your attention is at the rear of the truck. A roof spoiler with a twin-wing profile is prominent yet functional, increasing real downforce on the rear axle. High-gloss black trim is also found on the tailgate, around the tinted LED tail lights and finishes with two black twin tailpipes.Those tailpipes also speak a new language \u2014 which I\u2019d call controlled power. Two exhaust flaps have been built in between the rear silencers and tailpipe covers, which, when activated by the sport button, open, improving engine performance and announcing its presence in a clear, powerful bark. Brakes, too, get a unique GTS look with bright red painted calipers against the black background. These new brakes feature six-piston aluminum monobloc fixed calipers with 360-mm-diameter discs in front and four-piston calipers and 330-mm-diameter discs at the rear. The drive route for this introduction was through the Tyrolean Mountains of Austria, a backdrop that offered plenty of hairpin turns and switchbacks. It\u2019s these roads that really woke me to the sound of the GTS. The exhaust has been engineered to offer a guttural growl when the SUV is kicked in Sport mode virtue of a piece of sound-conducting technology that has made its way into the Cayenne from the Carrera. The device captures engine and air induction sound and pushes it to the A-pillars, where it resonates inside the cabin, adding depth and harmony to the revs of the V8. The 4.8-litre engine gives the GTS a zero-to-100-kilometres-an-hour acceleration time of just 5.7 seconds. But even with this snarling beast under foot, if petted gently, it is said to achieve a fuel economy of 10.7 litres per 100 kilometres. The Cayenne uses Porsche\u2019s all-wheel-drive system, which seems to stick the SUV to the payment like glue. Paddle shifters on a sport-design steering wheel got me around the track that much quicker using manual control of the eight-speed transmission.Inside, the GTS is set apart from the herd with a standard leather interior, including numerous Alcantara trims. The seat centre panels, the centre console armrest, parts of the door panel as well as the roofliner and pillar trim are done in Alcantara (a faux suede material). Other design cues (some optional) include contrasting stitching in Carmine Red or Peridot on the dashboard, door elements, seats and centre console armrest, while embroidered GTS lettering can be put on the headrests, the safety belts and the stitching on the foot mats in various colours. Last but coolest, Porsche is introducing the Sport Chrono Package in the Cayenne GTS. It comprises a stopwatch on the dashboard and a performance display in the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system. Now with six models in total (including the diesel, which is also coming to Canada late this year), there really is a Cayenne for just about every taste.The GTS is due to arrive in Canada in late September at a base price of $93,600.powersports@sympatico.ca \n                    "@en .
