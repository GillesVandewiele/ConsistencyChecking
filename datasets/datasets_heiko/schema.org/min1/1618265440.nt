It flies is well suited for both backhand and forehand shots. Many players have switched to the Cro for accurate, predictably stable drives and approaches. The stability of the Cro is comparable to that of a Roc or a Shark, but it will fly a little faster and with less glide. A lot of top pros use the Cro when they want the flight of the Roc without the added glide of the Roc. The rim depth and shape offer a smooth release. It is a great choice for consistent flights, power players, breezy days, sidearm shots, medium range headwind drives. It is a fantastic disc for a variety of mid range shots.Speed 5, Glide 3, Turn 0, Fade 2About Star plastic in general - it has the durability of Champion plastic with the superior all-weather grip of Pro plastic. Star discs have the same flight rating characteristics of Champion discs, although some Star Lite discs may be slightly more high-speed stable. Star retains flight characteristics longer than DX or Pro Plastics.About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Star colors.
