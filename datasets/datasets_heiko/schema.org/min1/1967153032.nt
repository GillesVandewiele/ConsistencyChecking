As of June 1, 2012, Delta Airlines has a new, more accommodating peanut allergy policy.\nHere is what the new policy states:\n\n\nWhen you notify us that you have a peanut allergy, we'll create a buffer zone of three rows in front of and three rows behind your seat. Effective on flights operating June 1, 2012 and beyond, when you notify us that you have a peanut allergy, we\u2019ll refrain from serving peanuts and peanut products onboard your flight. We'll also advise cabin service to board additional non-peanut snacks, which will allow our flight attendants to serve these snack items to everyone within this area. \u00A0Gate agents will be notified in case you'd like to pre-board and cleanse the immediate seating area. We'll do everything we can, but unfortunately we still can't guarantee that the flight will be completely peanut-free.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is encouraging to see that airlines are making progress in understanding food allergies and that they are doing their best to keep ALL of their passengers safe.\n\n\n\n" .
