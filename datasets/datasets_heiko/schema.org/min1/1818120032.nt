He had shipped it to Omaha, but decided to travel with it on his departure. Let\u2019s be clear, it was completely innocent. He had no way of knowing his improvised mint tin would look like an improvised explosive device (IED) on our X-ray monitor. Most people wouldn\u2019t realize it and the purpose of this post is to inform folks that homemade gadgets (however cool they may be) can look like improvised explosive devices to our officers on the X-ray monitors. You may remember a blog post from Nico about homemade gadgets from back in 2009. The devices we\u2019re looking for don\u2019t look like the Wile E. Coyote Acme bomb, they are smaller these days and much harder to find. \n\n \n\n\n\nI spoke with Dave today from TSA\u2019s Explosives Operation Division about what types of thing can cause your bag to be checked. Watch the video to see what he had to say.\n\nSo when you pack your bags for a trip, you may want to think about what items you are placing next to others to avoid the hassle of unintentionally creating an X-ray image which could cause TSA to conduct a further inspection of your carry-on and checked bags. \n\n\n\nBlogger Bob\n\nTSA Blog Team\u00A0\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to comment on an unrelated topic you can do so in our\u00A0Off Topic Comments\u00A0post.\u00A0You can also view our\u00A0blog post\u00A0archives\u00A0or\u00A0search\u00A0our  blog to find a related topic to comment in.
