However, if you got it going, it shouldn't be a particular problem.\n\nSecondly, the web support in dm Server is implemented against a particular level of Tomcat and it is not clear that replacing the Tomcat bundles will work. In particular, dm Server 2.0 relies upon a version of Tomcat 6 which includes changes backported from the Tomcat 7 line.\n"@en-us .

Do you want to apply updates to the dm Server code to the installations of dm Server on the clients? If so, dm Server does not support this, so you would have to write your own agent to perform the update.\n"@en-us .

An application on this would call web services from a remote application provider to fulfill some of the business functionalities. \nAssuming that Tomcat is also deployed as an OSGi bundle within dm Server. I was thinking that if required will it be possible for me to update the Tomcat version later if required. Eg. update from 5.5 to 6.1\nWhat i found from Equinox and other docs is that I can write a startup bundle that would start with the Equinox startup. This would contact a remote central repository to check for updates. \nThis is what i am talking about http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/documents/quickstart.php\nSo i can have a startup listener that would check for updates as soon as the Equinox platform starts and before the application starts i can update my client version and update if required.\nPlease let me know your views on this.\n"@en-us .
