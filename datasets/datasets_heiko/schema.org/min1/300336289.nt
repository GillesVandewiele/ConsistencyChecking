The Archangel\u2019s high glide, fast speed and turning characteristic all combine to stretch out distance shots. This disc flies very well with a tailwind! The Archangel also doubles as an easy to turn roller disc. Lighter weights work great for younger disc golf players, and an all around great disc for beginners. The DX Archangel is a great disc for beginning players who desire longer distance for an affordable price. 21.2 cm diameterDX discs are affordably priced and provide an excellent grip in all types of weather conditions. Over time, DX discs will take on new and varied flight characteristics that stem from their use. They start out more overstable, but with use will match the flight ratings. With continued use, they'll eventually become more understable than the ratings.About Color and Availability - Pictured above are some available DX colors.
