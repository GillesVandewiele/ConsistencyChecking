According to Clayton Morris at Fox News, Apple plans on offering two versions of the device, each made to run on one of the network standards.\n\"According to a source at Verizon, Apple has been in talks with 'the big red map' to offer the tablet on its robust CDMA network. Additionally Verizon is in talks with Apple to bring the iPhone to its network by late spring or early summer, but specifics haven't yet been finalized,\" Morris writes.\n\"The company's version of the tablet will feature built-in Wi-Fi utilizing Verizon's hotspots for free data; the device will switch onto the 3G cellular network when it's away from a hotspot.\u00C2*This makes it easy and safe to connect to trusted Wi-Fi servers, and you'll get a line-item for that data service on your cell bill.\u00C2*Basically you won't need a home data modem service anymore,\" continues Morris.\nIn a report by AppleInsider earlier Thursday, it was noted that other people with proven track records in predicting Apple's future product designs have recently commented on prototypes of the Apple tablet making the rounds with a baseband chip compatible with CDMA networks like those operated by U.S.-based Verzion Wireless. However, AppleInsider cannot confirm with any degree of certainty that this technology is planned for the shipping version of the product.\nApple has also been reportedly in \"secret\" last-minute talks with the six largest trade publishers in the U.S. The talks are currently underway in New York. A deal may not be able to be reached in time for the unveiling, something that Morris says could also be the case with Apple's talks with AT&T and Verizon.[ View this article at AppleInsider.com ]\n .AppleInsider-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { margin-top: 30px; width: 500px; height: 50px; }            if (fromsearch)        { document.write('       <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></scr' + 'ipt>          <div>  \t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle AppleInsider-Threads-First-Post-500x50\" style=\"display:inline-block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8810354328358242\" data-ad-slot=\"5786648818\">  \t</ins>             <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</scr' + 'ipt></div>');      }      else {       document.write('       <script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></scr' + 'ipt>   \t<div><ins class=\"adsbygoogle AppleInsider-Threads-First-Post-500x50\" style=\"display:inline-block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8810354328358242\" data-ad-slot=\"6607452411\"></ins>  \t<script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</scr' + 'ipt></div>');     }     \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .
