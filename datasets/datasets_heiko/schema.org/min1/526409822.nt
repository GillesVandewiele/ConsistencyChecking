Go for the win; unless your name is LeBron James, you have a very, VERY low chance of them calling a foul unless your blatantly murdered\u2026\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \nhttp://www.myspace.com/626bones                Lakers 24 7\n            \n        \n        \n            Fisher is not the one to create a shot for himself, especially with only 2 seconds left. If he was set up for a wide open shot, then I\u2019d let him take it, but that ball should\u2019ve went to either Artest or Odom.\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                LGM10\n            \n        \n        \n            since pau cant do much in the paint that late considering hes swarmed, i would have gone with lamar or ron, preferably lamar because he can create his own shot. Like ppl mention here, fish is better sited for a spot up three. In this situation i think fish should have inbounded and then quickly receive the ball back for a quick 3. WIth that little time its hard to say but LEBRON was able to do so much with 1.9 in the game before this one; interesting that the clock started late for him\u2026.so many clock issues in cleveland (the atlanta non-reset almost happened again to denver last night)\u2026..\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                lakerfan_4ever\n            \n        \n        \n            I couldn\u2019t agree more\u2026even Vujacic can dribble to create a shot off a screen,I\u2019m not saying he will make it but at least creates the space\u2026.Fish is not that type of player\u2026I put this loss on Phil Jackson,fist because he didn\u2019t design a play that will allow us to take a quality shot,what Pau was doing in the paint when he could have set up a screen on Allen to free up Fish?\u2026secondly,with 2.2 sec we know the only player in our roster with a higher percentage is Kobe,but why set the play for Fish when he was colder than a tuna sandwich?..\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Anthony\n            \n        \n        \n            Give me a damn break. He took one of the worst attempted buzzer beaters I\u2019ve ever seen. You\u2019ve guys have already pointed out what he did wrong, but I mean seriously he tried to draw a foul? Fish has made his fair share of huge shots and been a great player for these Lakers but little by little I wish they\u2019d bench him.\nTaking another angle on this. Does Phil Jackson ever strike you as momentarily dumb? I\u2019ve never seen a more poorly run out of bounds play then that one there. These Lakers need to stop depending on their talent so much and get back to some of the basics.\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp://www.myspace.com/guszo                gus26\n            \n        \n        \n            you\u2019re right about phil, sometimes he makes the dumbest substitutions.. i mean when they came back from behind and lamar hit the 3 and then they fouled brown.. why did he bring in bynum to break up the flow the players on the court had built?\u2026 i still say it should have been pau, lamar, sasha, brown and farmar who should have finished that game.. the speed was killing the celtics..\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                LAALLDAY213\n            \n        \n        \n            So to add more salt to an open wound, they\u2019re saying Fisher BROKE OFF the set play, similar to what Bryant does on inbound plays. I don\u2019t want Fisher taking a last second shot, unless he\u2019s spotting up ready to recieve the pass. He is not one to create or get off his own shot by himself. Also please stop looking for a foul, he does it on his LAYUPS ALL THE TIME!!\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \nhttp://vinginor@aol.com                onlyone laker fan in L.A.\n            \n        \n        \n            The lose is one Phil. Why the fuck didnt he call time out himself. Whenve Pau called the time out the clock was still running only one ref even heard him, Thats on Phil\nclock managment is the coaches control.\nThen fisher what the hell was that we played the whole came to piss it away on old man fish.\nEveryone knows he is in a shoting slump  read the scout reports dude is shoting like 30 per cent. Then he cant create a shot and is to small Ray Allen punked him all night, PHIL WHAT THE HELL .\nThis was a horrible display of coaching  Fisher should have  been the decoy and ball to Pau or Lamar or Arrtest\nto at least get the foul.\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                mamba1108\n            \n        \n        \n            Gotta disagree with you, stats prove nothing when its a last minute shot.

I don\u2019t care but I would\u2019ve given the ball to Fisher because he is a veteran and he has proven himself to everyone that he can make shots in the clutch.

The refs 99.999% of the time wont call a foul in that situation.  They absolutely hate making a call that decides the outcome of the game\u2026\nAt the same time however, I have to pin some of the blame for the loss on Pau.  In the critical minutes of the game when the lakers desperately needed points, rather then going to work in the paint, he passes the ball out to the guards who were shooting 3-287.  This is especially evident on that oner play where he threw an awful pass to shannon rather then going to work in the paint, leading to a turnover, and he gets mad about not getting touches in the clutch.  Please grow a pair Pau\u2026\n\ncialis generic effectiveness\u00A0click here\u00A0fast cash englewood\u00A0amoxicillin reactions\u00A0cipro for staphylococcus\u00A0Go Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n            \n\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n/* <![CDATA[ */\n    var disqus_url = 'http://lakernation.com/fisher-is-willing-to-take-the-last-shot/';\n    var disqus_identifier = '19690 http://lakernation.com/?p=19690';\n    var disqus_container_id = 'disqus_thread';\n    var disqus_domain = 'disqus.com';\n    var disqus_shortname = 'tln';\n    var disqus_title = \"Fisher is willing to take the last shot\";\n    var disqus_config = function () {\n        var config = this; // Access to the config object\n        config.language = '';\n\n        /* Add the ability to add javascript callbacks */\n        \n        /*\n           All currently supported events:\n            * preData \u2014 fires just before we request for initial data\n            * preInit - fires after we get initial data but before we load any dependencies\n            * onInit  - fires when all dependencies are resolved but before dtpl template is rendered\n            * afterRender - fires when template is rendered but before we show it\n            * onReady - everything is done\n         */\n\n        config.callbacks.preData.push(function() {\n            // clear out the container (its filled for SEO/legacy purposes)\n            document.getElementById(disqus_container_id).innerHTML = '';\n        });\n                config.callbacks.onReady.push(function() {\n            // sync comments in the background so we don't block the page\n            var script = document.createElement('script');\n            script.async = true;\n            script.src = '?cf_action=sync_comments&post_id=19690';\n\n            var firstScript = document.getElementsByTagName( \"script\" )[0];\n            firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(script, firstScript);\n        });\n                    };\n/* ]]> */\n\n\n\n/* <![CDATA[ */\n    var DsqLocal = {\n        'trackbacks': [\n        ],\n        'trackback_url': \"http:\\/\\/lakernation.com\\/fisher-is-willing-to-take-the-last-shot\\/trackback\\/\"    };\n/* ]]> */\n\n\n\n/* <![CDATA[ */\n(function() {\n    var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript';\n    dsq.async = true;\n    dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.' + 'disqus.com' + '/' + 'embed' + '.js' + '?pname=wordpress&pver=2.77';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);\n})();\n/* ]]> */\n\n                    "@en-us .
