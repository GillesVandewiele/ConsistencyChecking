He did point out that rock isn\u2019t Sanchez\u2019s \u201Cforte\u201D but said he still loves her voice.\u00A0\n\n\u201CYou were good today,\u201D Tyler added. \u201CGood for you.\u201D\n\nMusic executive Randy Jackson agreed with Tyler, saying he was impressed with the way Sanchez \u201Cchanged herself from what she naturally does.\u201D\n\n\u201CI love it,\u201D said Jackson. \u201CWhat you did is used great restraint. You\u2019re mad young. You\u2019re 16. You\u2019re unbelievably talented.\u201D\n\nJackson did give Sanchez some advice on channeling her inner rock star.\n\n\u201CWatch Tina Turner,\u201D said Jackson. \u201CShe\u2019s that big voice in rock in the female form.\u201D\n\nSuperstar Jennifer Lopez liked Sanchez\u2019s rendition of the tune, but felt she lacked the rock aspect in her performance.\n\n\u201CHere\u2019s the thing, you sounded beautiful singing that song,\u201D Lopez said. \u201CWhen it went into the more rock part of it\u2026in needed more of that rock performance.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut, all in all, great performance,\u201D Lopez added.\n\nAs the evening carried on, Sanchez became emotional, as she revealed that her father would soon be deployed to Singapore.\n\n\u201CMy dad was been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan,\" Sanchez said. \"And now he will be deployed again to Singapore.\u201D\n\nThe Filipino-Mexican singer added that it has been difficult to deal with news of his deployment because she\u2019s \u201Csuch a daddy\u2019s girl.\u201D\n\nSanchez then took the stage again, this time slowing it down and singing Luther Vandross\u2019 \u201CA Night With my Father.\u201D\n\nAs a silhouette in the background appeared of a father carrying a baby, Sanchez was nearly in tears, singing the tribute to her father.\n\nThe judges were happy with her performance.\u00A0\n\n\u201CLuther Vandross is one of my favorite singers ever,\u201D Lopez said. \u201CI don't think we've seen anyone sing it that good.\u201D\n\nTo prove her point, JLO then told Sanchez how she\u2019s heard many renditions of that song while being a judge on Idol.\n\n\u201C[It was] the feeling for me,\" Lopez added. \u201CIt\u2019s the most beautiful I've heard it.\u201D\n\nTyler told Sanchez he loves her versatility as a singer and that it has been a pleasure to see her \u201Cevolve\u201D musically throughout the competition.\n\n\u201CI don't think you can sing a song badly,\u201D Tyler said. \u201CIt touches on Whitney but you also got your own thing going on.\u201D\n\nLike Tyler and Lopez, Jackson was even more impressed a second time around.\n\n\u201CI'm so amazed at the talent this year,\u201D said Jackson.\u201DYou are truly amazing.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re so natural. It flows and, like Jennifer said, now you got the feeling, that connection. Every time you sing you know what's wrong with it? Absolutely nothing,\u201D a pleased Jackson said.\n\nSanchez said she was content with her performance, adding that she couldn\u2019t wait to see her father, who was stopping by Thursday night.\n\n\u201CI haven't seen him in so long,\u201D Sanchez said. \u201CTo see him before he goes to Singapore will be amazing.\u201D\n\nOn Thursday evening, American Idol alum and part Mexican singer Stefano Langone will take the stage with singer Katy Perry.\n\nYou can reach Alexandra Gratereaux at: Alexandra.Gratereaux@foxnewslatino.com or via Twitter: @GalexLatino\n\nVIDEO CREDIT: AMERICAN IDOL\"/FREMANTLEMEDIA NORTH AMERICA, INC/19 TV.
