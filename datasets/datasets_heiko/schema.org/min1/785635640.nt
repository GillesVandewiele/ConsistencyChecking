_:node11f5a66c63facecfce427a5ebf96fb7d <http://schema.org/reviewBody> "I went with this recipe hoping to make the potato part in my crockpot.......but my crockpot died. I transferred everything to a large soup pot and went on with the recipe. I actually made a double recipe of this with the intent of leftovers for tomorrow. After the potatoes cooked, I mushed them with the old fashioned potato masher, then folded in the cheese sauce. I did not use half-n-half in this recipe, I used whole \"lactose-free\" milk in it's place. That made no difference in the taste of the soup. After tasting it, I did add in more garlic powder and hot pepper sauce. This was a very nice cheese-potato soup. My husband and kids especially liked it. The flavor of the Velveeta went well with the potatoes--the flavor reminded me of scalloped potatoes." .
