_:node179e13ab77ffcd4fc148844d723c4 <http://schema.org/articleBody> "\n              \n    Back in January I wrote an article entitled \u201CKnicks Represent Decline of a Culture in New York City,\u201D which documented what has become of the once mighty New York hoops scene.\nThe two men I held responsible in that article were Mike Jarvis and Isiah Thomas, who ruined St. John\u2019s and the Knicks respectively.\nThese are two men who I never thought would work in basketball ever again. Unfortunately for people who care about basketball (unless you have a twisted sense of humor like me, then it\u2019s hysterical) two athletic directors at rival Florida universities weren\u2019t paying attention.\nThat\u2019s right, Mike Jarvis and Isiah Thomas will be pacing the sidelines in a division one rivalry game; coaching Florida Atlantic and Florida International respectively.\nBack in December, I wrote about the illustrious Mike Jarvis era at St. John\u2019s. Dr. Mike left halfway through the 2004 season and the program has never been the same.\nSt. John\u2019s is now an afterthought in the Big East. Games against UConn, that used to sell out the 20,000 seat Madison Square Garden, now attract crowds of under 8,000 fans.\nNorm Roberts, the current coach of St. John\u2019s is still picking up the pieces five years later.\nOne of Mike Jarvis\u2019 shortcomings was his reluctance to actively recruit. Jarvis just wasn\u2019t a very good salesman, he felt the program sold itself.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Isiah Thomas is nothing more than a salesman.\nHe was able to sell the Knicks' management on keeping him around for four and a half years as he wrote the manual on how not to run an NBA team. The Knicks never finished better than 39-43 with Isiah at the helm.\nIsiah\u2019s gaffs with the Knicks have been well documented. The Eddy Curry trade, the Steve Francis trade, the Jerome James signing, the sexual harassment lawsuit, the list is seemingly endless. And this is just with the Knicks.\nThis is the same man who, since he finished playing, failed as a broadcaster, took the job as commissioner of the CBA and ran them into chapter 11, failed as a GM with the Raptors, and failed as a coach with the Pacers.\nThat brings us to this upcoming season, where Florida Atlantic and Florida International will face off twice a year in the Sun Belt conference. It will be just like Duke-UNC, except the opposite.\nWhat if you\u2019re a New York kid that projects as a mid-major prospect and these two clowns are trying to recruit you? Does Isiah try to sell you on the chance to stick it to Jarvis? If Jarvis actually recruited would he sell the kid on sticking it to Isiah?\nIf either the MSG network or SNY has a sense of humor (YES certainly doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor), these two games will be shown in 3D so New Yorkers can pretend to strike Thomas and Jarvis when they come into the picture.\nWe already watched these two ruin the game in New York, you might as well give us the perverse enjoyment of watching them ruin it somewhere else.\n\n            "@en .
