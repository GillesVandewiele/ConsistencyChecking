While the monuments and museums of the two great cities of Damascus and Aleppo have so far largely been spared, reports from across Syria tell of irreparable damage to heritage sites that have no equal in the Middle East.\u201D\n\nThree things are going on at once: concern for historical sites is trampled by the hostilities; looting; and even ethnic cleansing. Fisk again.\nIn Croatia and Bosnia in the early 1990s, I saw the same thing. The pulverisation of mosques and Catholic and Orthodox churches, the smashing of gravestones \u2013 even the bulldozing of graveyards \u2013 were a form of cultural cleansing that reached its apogee in the burning of the old Sarajevo library.\n\nThe souls of Iraq and Syria are irreparably damaged when their link to their heritage as the cradle of civilization is frayed. Indeed, the world is much the worse for it. \u201CThis is why it is so important,\u201D writes Fisk, \u201Cto have an inventory of the treasures of national museums and ancient cities. Emma Cunliffe, a PhD researcher at Durham University, published the first detailed account of the state of Syrian archeological sites in her Damage to the Soul of Syria: Syria\u2019s Cultural Heritage in Conflict, listing the causes of destruction, the use of sites as military positions and what can only be called merciless looting.\u201D\nMs. Cunliffe\u2019s report, issued in May of this year, can be viewed or downloaded free at the Global Heritage Network in May of this year.\n\n"@en-us .
