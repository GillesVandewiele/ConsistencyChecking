_:nodeb5edc7fa8da3c1676dea402ab612d17e <http://schema.org/description> "The Tank that player\u2019s fell in love with in the 90's is back!The HyzerBomb Tank - Base-Soft is a beginner friendly stable putt and approach disc that is softer and more flexible than the Panzer Tank. It boasts a broad sided, chain blasting profile with an extra wide patented secure Thumtrac\u00AE grip. The rim is beefed up for a heavy duty feel that makes the disc 'hover-stop-drop'. Ideal for treacherous approach shots. Released with power, this disc will hold a straight line with very little glide giving you control on short to mid range shots. Not as good in the wind as the Panzer. Beginner friendly.Available in Base-Soft plastic in weights 170-175 grams." .
