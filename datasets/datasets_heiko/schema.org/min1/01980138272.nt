I can't even help myself anymore; it has become totally automatic.\n\n\"I\u2019m always afraid that I\u2019m being unprofessional, yet I continue to sign all my e-mails 'xoxo,' \" Lena Dunham joked to the New York Times Magazine earlier this year.\n\nA recent Atlantic article examined the phenomenon, which they say is feminizing the workplace: \"'I feel like xo has taken on its own kind of life,' says Karli Kasonik, a Washington-based consultant. 'I do it, most women I know do it,' says Asie Mohtarez, a writer and social-media editor, noting that she prefers a single x to the full xo. 'In my field, you almost have to use it,' says Kristin Esposito, a yoga instructor in New York.\"\n\nFunnily enough, xoxo-ing has become such a habit that I feel kind of mean when I don't include it. \"There\u2019s the matter of women\u2019s tonal antennae, which pick up on even the smallest shifts,\" continues the Atlantic article. \"'In e\u2011mail, ending a command with a period can feel brusque,' says Anne Trubek, a professor of rhetoric at Oberlin College...In Diane Sawyer\u2019s newsroom, staffers say, the anchor uses xo so frequently that its omission can spark panic.\"\n\nAnd it's not just for women. My deep-voiced, bearded husband has started picking it up, and my dad's classic sign-off is now a bold \"xxOOO.\" (I think those are bear hugs.)\n\nAfter all, xoxo doesn't actually mean \"kiss\" anymore (at least, I'm not planning to kiss my accountant, sweet as he is). It's similar to \"how the epistolary greeting Dear changed over time, originally just for addressing loved ones but eventually becoming neutral,\" says Ben Zimmer, a linguist and lexicologist, in the article.\n\nSo, is xoxo unprofessional or a new industry standard? \"I refuse to feel any shame for this widespread woman-trait,\u201D Caitlin Moran, the British feminist and author of How to Be a Woman, told the Atlantic. \u201CStatistics show we\u2019re slowly taking over the world, and I\u2019m happy for us to do it one xxx e\u2011mail at a time.\u201D\n\nWhat do you think? I'd love to hear... xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo \n(Thanks, Courtney)\n\n" .
