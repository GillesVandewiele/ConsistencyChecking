It is an easy to learn disc, and in lighter weights will give newer players extra distance. Lighter weights also give players extreme range when thrown downwind, while maximum weights can give excellent upwind distance. The Valkyrie\u2019s high speed turn and flight characteristics make it great choice for long range turnover shots and rollers. 21.2 cm diameter.It is a great choice for a beginner's first distance driver, tailwind drives, downhill distance, long turnover drives, and rollers.The Glow Champion Line is made with the same high-tech durable plastic as the Champion Line with the added benefit of glowing in the dark. Glow Champion discs are easily distinguished by their translucent greenish-yellow hue. Highly durable and easy to spot, the Champion Glow Line is perfect for Glow Disc Golf.The Valkyrie is a World Record holder.

It is an incredibly versatile disc for me. It works very well with my throwing style. I tend to throw low and the Valkyrie gets great distance with low thrown shots. I typically carry three Valkyries with me during a round. One is beat and used for long turnover shots. The others can be used for hyzers and subtle helix shots.\" - Juliana KorverIf you are looking for a disc with more Glide, try the Mako more Turn, try the Sidewinder more Fade, try the FirebirdOther Speed 9 discs include the Firebird, FL, Roadrunner, Sidewinder and Viking." .
