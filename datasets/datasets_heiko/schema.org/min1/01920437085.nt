This writeup, on the other hand, will be devoted to the modern mutations of this tune as performed by the children of America (and probably other countries, too). These various versions of the song are often adapted as clapping rhymes and jump rope rhymes.  \n\n First of all, it should be noted that since the seventies, France has more and more frequently been replaced with Mars. I don't know why this is, but it seems to fit in well with the song's gradual drift into nonsense. I won't try to put the various lyrics I've found in chronological order, but I will start with the older 'France' version, and 'progress' to the 'Mars' version. Have fun, and sing along! \n\n\nThere\u2019s a place in France, \nWhere the naked ladies dance. \nThere\u2019s a hole in the wall, \nWhere the men watch it all. \nBut the men don't care,  \n'Cuz they chew their underwear, \nAnd the underwear they chew  \nCosts a dollar ninety two. \n\n\n I don't know where this came from; it doesn't seem to have any relation to Streets Of Cairo (except for the melody). If you have any information on this, let me know. It doesn't sound like something that was created entirely by children, although any song involving nudity and underwear is bound to popular in the schoolyard. The next version I have does sound like something that might be a youngster's attempt at a 'dirty' song, using the previous as a basis. \n\n\nThere's a place in France \nWhere the naked ladies dance, \nAnd the dance they do \nIs enough to kill a Jew, \nAnd the Jew they kill \nIs enough to take a pill, \nAnd the pill they take \nIs enough to fry a snake, \nAnd the snake they fry \nIs enough to tell a lie, \nAnd the lie they tell \nIs enough to go to hell. \n\n\n\nFrom here on out it gets more milquetoast; perhaps an adult got hold of it, rewrote it, and re-released it to the local urchins. I seem to recall hearing a version of this on a Sharon, Lois, and Bram record in the 80s; however I believe that this next version was around in the 70s. It is in this version that you start seeing Mars most often, although France is still used occasionally.  \n\n\nThere\u2019s a place on Mars \nWhere the ladies smoke cigars, \nAnd the men don't care \n'Cause they eat their underwear.* \n\n\n\nI can't find the verse that follows... something about Grandma being a witch, I think. I'll keep looking. But more often the couplet about the men is dropped, and a snake is introduced to take his place. This is close to what Sharon, Lois, and Bram sang. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a place on Mars \nWhere the Ladies Smoke Cigars; \nEvery Puff They Take \nIs Enough To Kill A Snake. \nWhen The Snake is Dead, \nThey Put Roses in Their Heads. \nWhen The Roses Die, \nThey Put Diamonds In Their Eyes. \nWhen The Diamonds Break, \nIt's The End of 78. \n(or 88, or 98... I don't know what they use these days. 08?)\n\n\nOne more before I leave you; on much the same vein as the last one, here is the extended 'one, two, buckle my shoe' version. This is 'specially formulated as a jump rope rhyme. \n\n\nThere's a place on Mars \nwhere the ladies smoke cigars \nevery puff they take \nis enough to kill a snake. \nWhen the snake is dead \nyou put diamonds in his head. \nWhen the diamonds break \nit's enough to bake a cake \nWhen the cake is done \nit is 1991. \nWhen you tie your shoe \nit is 1992. \nWhen you get stung by a bee \nit is 1993. \nWhen you slam a door \nit is 1994. \nWhen you dance the jive \nit is 1995. \nWhen you pick up sticks \nit is 1996. \nWhen you like a boy named Devon \nit is 1997. \nWhen you close the gate \nit is 1998. \nWhen you're feelin' fine \nit is 1999. \nThen it gets all cold \nthen you Freeze!\n\n\n\n\n\n* Did I say milquetoast? Well, sort of. I also found this one...\n\nIn the land of Oz \nWhere the women wear no bras \nAnd the men don't care \n'Cause they wear no underwear \nAnd there's a big fat genie \nWith an artificial weenie \nSo now you know \nWhy you shouldn't go \n \n\n\n\n\n\nCategories: \u00AB\u00A0\u00A0Jump rope rhymes\u00A0\u00A0\u00BB\u00AB\u00A0\u00A0Children's songs\u00A0\u00A0\u00BB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like it!\n2 C!s\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStreets Of Cairo\n\t\tMy dog's name is Ici\n\t\tMilquetoast\n\t\tjump rope rhymes\n\t\n\t\tAcka Backa\n\t\tReally?\n\t\tHere is the Church\n\t\tSmoking a fake Cohiba\n\t\n\t\tSome thoughts on weaving, and the future\n\t\tlawn mower\n\t\tnaked\n\t\tThe Titanic\n\t\n\t\tSurvivor2\n\t\tFrance\n\t\tThe sun rose over the Champs-\u00C9lys\u00E9es\n\t\tchildish ideas\n\t\n\t\tInvesting in Uncle Sam\n\t\tE2 Annex\n\t\tMadeleine Peyroux\n\t\tJanuary 16, 2003\n\t\n\t\tBentley Bear\n\t\tLittle Egypt\n\t\tLa Pointe\n\t\t\u00A0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"@en .
