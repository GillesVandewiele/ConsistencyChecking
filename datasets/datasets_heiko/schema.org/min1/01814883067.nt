Did he accomplish that goal?\nThe WWE is not big enough for The Shield and The Wyatt Family, so which side looked better at the end of the night?\nWho else stood out on the pay-per-view, delivering quality performances or getting huge victories?\nIt's time to review the biggest stars of the evening.\n            "@en .

_:node2a379d3ebf7b786e815fc52078e84b <http://schema.org/articleBody> "\n              \n    \nThe Shield weren't the only ones we can give credit to for the great six-man tag match at this event, as The Wyatt Family did extremely well, too.\nJust as it would have been easy to make Roman Reigns the only star on his team, WWE could have booked Bray Wyatt as the only valuable member of The Wyatt Family's side of things, but that didn't happen.\nErick Rowan held his own throughout the match and didn't come off as awkward as he's done in the past.\nLuke Harper in particular really came out of his shell and actually could be considered one of the overall best performers of the night, pulling out multiple great spots.\nThis was an intense match with both sides looking strong, and The Wyatt Family coming out on top just helps their credibility so much more.\n            "@en .

Is there anyone not on this list that you feel should be?\nLeave your comments below!\nAnthony Mango is the owner-operator of the wrestling website\u00A0Smark Out Moment as well as the host of its podcast show Smack Talk on YouTube, iTunes and Stitcher.
