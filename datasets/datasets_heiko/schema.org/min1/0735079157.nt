Can you show me your angry face? I\u2019m going to give you\neach a balloon that you can sit on and pop. Try to make an angry\nface while you pop your balloon.\nHow did you feel when you popped your balloon? What\u2019s left of\nyour balloon?\nLet\u2019s listen to God\u2019s Word. (Read the Scripture.)\n  \n    \n    Kids LOVE these Sunday School resources! \n    Check 'em out and see why so many children's ministries around the world are having success with Group's products!\n  \n\nIf we go to bed mad enough to pop, there\u2019s usually something\nleft over in the morning from our anger. We may still be angry at\nour friends, or we may still feel yucky in the morning. God doesn\u2019t\nwant us to go to bed angry. God wants us to ask for forgiveness\nfrom any person we\u2019ve hurt. And God also wants us to forgive anyone\nwho\u2019s made us mad enough to pop. That\u2019ll make us feel better,\ntoo!\nLet\u2019s pray. God, help us forgive our friends who hurt us and ask\nour friends to forgive us. Amen.\n\nJanice Long is a former editorial assistant for Children\u2019s\nMinistry Magazine.
