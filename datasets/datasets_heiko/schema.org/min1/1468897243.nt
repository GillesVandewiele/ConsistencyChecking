Here's a look at some late-round gems that will leave you sitting pretty once your league's draft has concluded.Note: Average draft position courtesy of MyFantasyLeague.com.\n            "@en .

With rookie Russell Wilson being named the starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, the former Wisconsin standout is shooting up draft boards.However, after an outstanding exhibition season, in which Wilson threw for over 450 yards and added another 150 on the ground, the rookie definitely has the attention of the fantasy community\u2014especially given his ability to scramble.Sure, there's some risk involved in drafting such an unproven commodity, but you could do a lot worse than Wilson as an upside platoon option at quarterback or fantasy backup.\n            "@en .

Now, he's become a viable fantasy RB3.Not only did the 29-year-old latch on with the Green Bay Packers, but Benson has rapidly ascended to the top of the depth chart in Titletown. Running backs coach Alex Van Pelt told Vic Ketchman of Packers.com that Benson adds \"explosiveness\" to the Green Bay ground game.The eighth-year pro topped 1,000 rushing yards each of the past three seasons. And while the Packers are hardly a grind-it-out team, Benson should see enough work to at least merit consideration as a flex player or quality fantasy reserve.\n            "@en .

And with his ADP still hovering around the 13th round, I'm going to keep right on hyping him.With Mark Ingram nursing a balky knee last year, Thomas was once again a factor in the Saints offense. He totaled nearly 1,000 yards, scored six touchdowns and finished as a top-20 fantasy back in leagues that award a point for receptions.Despite the fact that Ingram's knee is still an issue, the second-year pro is being drafted a full five rounds earlier than Thomas. But for my money, I'll roll the dice that Ingram misses time and the Saints once again turn to the 27-year-old in the backfield.\n            "@en .

And as the primary underneath target in the Baltimore passing game, there's an excellent chance that the 10th-year pro will outperform his ADP this year.\n            "@en .
