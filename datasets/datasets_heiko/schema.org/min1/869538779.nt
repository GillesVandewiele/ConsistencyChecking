His Charlotte Bobcats currently owns the worst record in the NBA at 3-21.Even the train wreck that is the NBA owned-New Orleans Hornets has a better record. The Bobcats have lost their last 11 games, and are being outscored by an average of 14 points per game.Unfortunately, as you look at the team's current roster there seems to be no relief on the way.\u00A0Jordan has always made questionable personal decisions. Even as a player with the Bulls he encouraged the draft picks of guys like Corie Blount, Dickey Simpkins and the great Cory Benjamin.As minority owner and Director of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards, Jordan drafted Kwame Brown with the first overall pick in 2001. That same draft saw the selection of players like Pau Gasol, Jason Richardson, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Gilbert Arenas and Tony Parker.He even found a way to trade Richard Hamilton in his prime to the Detroit Pistons for Jerry Stackhouse and a handful of other players. This move helped to solidify the Pistons as a championship contender.\u00A0Jordan was subsequently fired by the late Abe Pollin in Washington. In 2010 he took over as majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats and named himself Director of Basketball Operations for the team.\n  \n    Is Michael Jordan the worst owner ever?\n    \n      \n                              \n              \n              Yes \n            \n                                        \n              \n              No\n            \n                                        \n              \n              No, it's the NBA for destroying the Hornets\n            \n                                        \n              \n              Shouldn't it be Donald Sterling?\n            \n                                                                                                                              \n        Submit Vote\n        vote to see results\n        \n\n                \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n      \n        Is Michael Jordan the worst owner ever?\n                              \n              Yes \n              \n                54.0%\n                \n              \n            \n                                        \n              No\n              \n                17.6%\n                \n              \n            \n                                        \n              No, it's the NBA for destroying the Hornets\n              \n                15.5%\n                \n              \n            \n                                        \n              Shouldn't it be Donald Sterling?\n              \n                12.9%\n                \n              \n            \n                                                                                                                              \n        Total votes: 1,416\n      \n    \n\n          \n        if (!BR.PollData) {\n          BR.PollData = {};\n        }\n\n        if (!BR.PollData[169750]) {\n          BR.PollData[169750] = {\n            id: 169750,\n            question: \"Is Michael Jordan the worst owner ever?\",\n            choices: {\"choice0\":{\"count\":765,\"choice\":\"Yes \"},\"choice1\":{\"count\":249,\"choice\":\"No\"},\"choice2\":{\"count\":219,\"choice\":\"No, it's the NBA for destroying the Hornets\"},\"choice3\":{\"count\":183,\"choice\":\"Shouldn't it be Donald Sterling?\"}},\n            sidebar: false\n          };\n        }\n\n        if (BR.poll) {\n          BR.poll.showResults(169750, false);\n        }\n      \n      His first poor decision was to allow Raymond Felton to leave via free agency to the New York Knicks. He then traded Tyson Chandler to the Dallas Mavericks for Eric Dampier, Eduardo Najera and Matt Carroll.Chandler was an\u00A0intricate\u00A0part of the Mavs' championship run last season. Rising star Gerald Wallace was not\u00A0immune to Jordan's poor transactions. He allowed Portland to be a relevant team, in spite of injuries to Brandon Roy and Greg Oden, by trading Wallace to the Blazers for Sean Marks, Dante Cunningham, Joel Przbilla and draft picks.Why trade an established player for draft picks when you do so poorly in that area? D.J Augustin, Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker are all mediocre high draft picks who seem to be lost on a team that lacks size and has DeSagana Diop as a starter.Most of all, there seems to be no plan in place in a city where basketball is dominated by college teams who sell out every night and arguably have more talent and direction.\u00A0Jordan further added to his resume as a poor owner during the NBA lockout when he publicly took a stand against the players. These are players who feel they deserve a more fair shake based upon what past players like Jordan opened up for them.\u00A0Time Warner Cable Arena has a\u00A0capacity of just over 19,000. They currently sit 16th in the NBA in attendance. This could free fall further if the talent does not improve.But, how could it? He's already given up a future lottery pick to the Chicago Bulls and has not shown he can draft a cornerstone for a franchise in his career.Jordan needs to step aside from running a team. He should focus on the business side of his franchise. A world where he has been largely successful. Without a doubt he is the league's greatest player of all time. However, Michael Jordan just might be the NBA's worst owner ever.\u00A0\n\n            "@en .
