You can also follow along on Facebook,  Twitter, and Instagram. If you have a relationship/dating question I can help answer, you can send me your letters at wendy@dearwendy.com.Thanks for visiting! Next week we\u2019ll discuss our January/February book club selection, Fault in Our Stars. But for now, it\u2019s time to vote on our next book. I thought a memoir would be a nice change of pace (I haven\u2019t read a memoir for a while), and I asked you guys for recommendations last week. I looked up every single book you mentioned (some of which I already read, so I ruled those out because I want to read something new), read reviews, researched bestseller lists over the last few years, and gave lots of careful consideration before finally deciding on these three selections:\n1. Fairyland: A Memoir of My Father\n\u201CA beautiful, vibrant memoir about growing up motherless in 1970s and \u201980s San Francisco with an openly gay father.\u201D\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\n2. Chanel Bonfire: A Memoir\n\u201CWith clear-eyed grace, refreshing honesty, and flashing wit, Wendy Lawless tells the true story of her unhinged upbringing in this New York Times bestselling memoir.\u201D\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\n3. Until I Say Good-Bye: My Year of Living with Joy\n\u201CA moving and inspirational memoir by a woman who makes the most of her final days after discovering she has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\u201D\n\u00A0\n\u00A0\nIf you\u2019re interested in participating in the book club, please cast your vote below for our next selection. I\u2019ll close the polls by noon tomorrow.
