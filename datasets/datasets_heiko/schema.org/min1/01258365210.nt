When Martin crosses the yard of Transitions, a homeless shelter in downtown Columbia, he\u2019s followed by a trail of cheerful hellos. Attired in a neatly pressed dress shirt, he is easily distinguishable from the clients around him. However, perhaps his own \u201Cdiverse past,\u201D as he calls it, makes clients more willing to view him as both an advocate and an example of breaking the cycle of homelessness.\n \nMartin graduated from USC\u2019s MSW program in 2012 and has years of experience in social work. Yet part of the unique perspective he brings to working with clients and mentoring field students comes from his experiences outside of the classroom, which include a year and half of homelessness and former struggles with substance abuse.\n\u201CMy experiences have allowed me to look at things differently from a lot of people,\u201D Martin said. \u201CI\u2019m able to give our clients a voice since I\u2019ve shared similar situations.\u201D\nMartin began his work as an MSW field intern at Transitions when the shelter opened in June 2011. His shift into the full-time position of Lead Day Counselor and then Emergency Services Program Manager has also moved him from the position of student to mentor.\nNow Martin acts as the field preceptor for the five MSW students from USC at Transitions. While some of their duties are clearly laid out, Martin emphasizes that it\u2019s important for students to have individual plans tailored to their goals and backgrounds. This gives students more freedom to explore their strengths and weaknesses while avoiding \u201Ccookie-cutter\u201D teaching formulas.\nAt Transitions, this openness has allowed for student-initiated events and projects, such as a client \u201Cfun day\u201D (replete with a talent show and carnival-like activities) and a short video production that Transitions may use in future marketing and public relations.\nMartin isn\u2019t going this path alone. While he has day-to-day oversight of the interns, Dave Hall, a PhD student at USC\u2019s College of Social Work, acts as the students\u2019 off-site field instructor.Hall, who has been in social work since the 1980s, said he helps students weave together what they\u2019re experiencing in the field with what they\u2019re learning in the classroom. He meets with students regularly, mentoring them and helping them process their experiences. He also challenges students to move past their internal roadblocks by helping them identify concerns and fears and then creating opportunities to face them in the practicum.\u00A0Martin and Hall\u2019s hard work is apparently paying off. Samaiyah White, a first-year MSW student interning at Transitions, said that at first she was \u201Ca little leery\u201D about working with the homeless population. But now that she serves as an assistant case manager for eight homeless women at Transitions, she wishes she could have more time in the field. \u201CI love the one-on-one contact I have with clients,\u201D she said. \u201CThey come to me feeling like I\u2019m their safety net when others might look at them and ignore them.\u201D\nThis is exactly the kind of perspective-changing experience that both Martin and Hall hope for. \u201CWith each month that goes by, students take on more responsibility, and they step up and grow,\u201D Martin said. \u201CIt\u2019s gratifying to see that I get to play a role in the future of a social worker and use my own wisdom and learning to help students achieve their dreams.\u201D\t"@en-gb .
