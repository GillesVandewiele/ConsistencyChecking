And I'm not going to sugarcoat it and say that it's been easy getting here. We sweated, some cried, at least one has bled (but that was to due to shoddy kitchen-knife skills) and we almost came to blows, but it's all done and it's ready for you. First, there's that giant thing poking out of the middle of this week's issue. That thick, glossy, beautifully covered and bound thing we've been whining about for months: Annual Manual. This is our inaugural edition of that slick mag, and it's something alt weeklies all over the country put together in their communities. Think of it as your encyclopedia of Boise. The sort of thing you send to your out-of-town friends to convince them that Idaho is not in the Midwest, and while Boise isn't a mega-metropolis, it's no backwater either. As it is our first, it's not perfect. But strive for perfection we do. As usual, ring us up, e-mail us, comment at boiseweekly.com and tell us what works, what doesn't and what we absolutely cannot, under any circumstances, forget or fail to do next year. Second, we have another first: Saturday, Aug. 28, we're gettin' down. The first-ever Big LeBoise--BW's craft sale, block party and music marathon--happens from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Broad Street in front of BWHQ. We've pulled permits to shut down the street and have a proper block blowout. Bright and early Saturday morning, almost 40 of the city's raddest crafty types will hawk their wares. The Bloody Mary Contest finals featuring bartenders from Quinn's and Piper Pub and Grill shaking it up for celebrity judges starts at 10 a.m. The music starts at 11 a.m. with seven bands and a dance party. The party rages all day with a kids' corner, food, drinks and the grand finale: a Vespa giveaway. Raffle tickets are $10, and you can still buy them. You don't have to be present to win (although you'll be missing out on some serious fun if you aren't present). See the center spread in this issue for more details. Finally, thanks, readers. Without your devotion, support and occasional attaboys we wouldn't be doing such kick-ass things as Annual Manual and the Big LeBoise. Now, come party with us. --Rachael Daigle\n\nCOVER ARTIST\nARTIST: Elizabeth Hilton TITLE: Cardboard Painting #4 MEDIUM: Transferred image, ink and nails on recycled cardboard squares on wood.

During a difficult summer of BP leaks here and Wikileaks there, of never-ending Gitmo and endless manic recession, what cranks Cope's angst? \"Mallard Fillmore.\" And how long did it take Cope to frame an almost lucid response to Fourth of July \"Fillmore?\" About five weeks, which makes Cope as topical as Doonesbury, an unfunny funny that's as timely and subtle as a footpowered dental drill. Garry Trudeau threatened to hold his breath and turn pink(er) if dailies didn't put his inanity on the op-ed page next to Ellen Goodman and Amy Goodman. All for fairness and balance. Meanwhile, the neosocialist Seattle P-I put \"Mallard Fillmore\" way back at the bottom of its classifieds before giving the bird and his words the boot. Then the P-I died, but \"Mallard Fillmore\" lives. Praise God. Whether \"Mallard\" makes you howl with mirth or howl with Bill Cope rage, he's a clothespin on the nose during a summer reeking of the orthodoxies of the Left despised by George Orwell. \"Mallard\" reminds you, because Bill Cope won't, that BP's biggest campaign payoffs went to [President] Barack Obama. That Obama surged Afghanistan and that it's his tar baby. Ditto Gitmo. And that almost $1 trillion of Obama stimulus, sold to keep unemployment below 8 percent, stimulated unemployment to almost 10 percent. So here we are. A summer of Bill Cope and Barack Obama. Of Goodman and Goodman and Doonesbury and Tom Tomorrow and \"News\"week's Luckovich and Boise \"Weakly's\" Ted Rall (who, to his credit, called for Obama's impeachment 15 months ago), all running the elitist statist quo gamut from far left to farther left. --Cody Kerns, Boise\n\nON THE COVER\nI might appreciate that cover (\"Stay Cool,\" Aug. 18, 2010) in someone's sketchbook, on a wall somewhere--I don't know--in a bar. But when my daughter, who's 6, looks at that today, tomorrow and the rest of the week--everywhere we go around town--and says, \"What's he doing to his privates?\" \"I don't know, cooling them off?\" I swear, that Leila, sometimes she picks some good stuff but for the most part, we--including most of the people I know--are at a loss when trying to figure out where she cultivated her taste. The art in my home and in my books isn't for all eyes, but is it displayed loud and proud for Boise families to swim around? Oh, I get it, you wanna be risque and hip? It's just tacky, honey. --Karabeth Shepherd, Boise\n\nS U B M I T Letters must include writer's full name, city of residence and contact information.

No lectures.\" \"Or ain't you gonna go on and on about how this country was founded on the liberties of some misfits believing whatever they wants, no matter how blasphemous and heretical and un-Godly it may be? And hows no one religion should get no more uppityness than any other religion since they all have Constitutional back-up to be here?\" \"Nope. Not with you and not today.\" \"Or ain't you gonna try to explain the difference between a Mooslim temple and a Mooslim community center? Or ain't you gonna insist how ol' President Barack Obama was right when he says we cain't be mixing up government stuff with churchy stuff? Or ain't you gonna elucidate me on hows it ain't temples what Mooslims put up anyhow, but mosques ... except when it's a community center they're putting up?\" \"Wouldn't try to elucidate you about a thing, Red.\" \"Ain't you even gonna try to get me to open up my heart and see how not all Mooslims are al Qaida killers or crazy Taliban ragheads? And how most Mooslims are just like you and me 'cept for when it comes to pig meat and Jesus? Ain't you gonna toss me a sermon 'bout hows all us human beings have more in common than we have in uncommon, even when a lot of them human beings is Mooslims or Hindus or Unitarians? Ain't you gonna remind me about hows if we don't let them Mooslims put up that temple, the terrorists have done won?\" \"No sermon tossing, boy-o. And you go right ahead and keep your heart closed, if that's what makes you happy.\" \"What's a matter with you, Cope? You sick?\" \"Bud, life's too short to waste any of it trying to tell ignorant xenophobic idiots\nWWW. B OISEWEEKLY.C O M\n\nMOSQUE DEAF\n\nanything.

Serious!\" \"C'mon, Red, who do you think you're kidding. You're loving this. After all those years of watching what comes out of your mouth for fear of losing a job or pissing off decent folks, you and your crowd can finally pick on brown people again. Oh sure, you have to make it sound like some kind of sincere concern for the future or some other phony poop about how much you love this country. But the truth is, you couldn't care less what happens in New York City, and we both know it. This is just another opportunity for you to bitch about whatever diverse people are doing.\" \"This ain't got nothing to do with that racist stuff! Them Mooslims are treading on hallowed ground. Hallowed ground, Cope! Don't you get that? This is about not letting un-American tendencies get a toehold in our holy places!\" \"Yeah, right. And the immigration debate has nothing to do with Mexicans, is that what you're gonna tell me next? And the hubbub over repealing the 14th Amendment has nothing to do with the babies being Hispanic? And Obama ... I suppose you'll claim all this hysteria over his birth certificate hasn't got jack to do with him being black. Shhhuuuure, Red. You right wingers are het up with all these major concerns, and it's all just a weird coincidence that most of those major concerns of yours are dark-skinned. Is that it? Just a big coincidence?\" \"Cope, trouble with you is, ever time you kick over a cow pie, you think you find a bigot squatting under it.\" \"I've been around your sort far too long to believe for a second that you've sluffed off 400 years of racial violence and supremacist attitudes, and now you've seen the enlightenment. Must be exhilarating, eh? ... to get back to your cracker roots and treat people of color like they don't deserve the same consideration and respect you'd give a hunting dog. What with Beck and Limbaugh and the rest of that trash, you must feel like a weight has been lifted from your tongue. In those circles, treating non-whites like vermin makes you a hero, doesn't it? Call a spade a spade ... not to mention a spic a spic, a gook a gook, or a raghead a raghead ... and the Right starts whistling Dixie. Better take care, Red. You ridicule enough cultural diversity and abuse enough of your fellow citizens, and those tea bagger pals of yours might decide to run you for Congress.\" \"Hey, Mr. Elitist Snooty Face. They could do worse.\" \"No doubt, Red. And before it's over, I'm sure they will.\"\n\nBOISEweekly | AUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | 7\n\n\u000COPINION/TED RALL\n\nNEW WAR, SAME FEARS\nNine years later, Afghan city is buzzing\nTALOQAN, AFGHANISTAN--Nine years ago, when I was using this provincial Afghan capital as a base to cover the battle of Kunduz, Taloqan was a dangerous place with medieval charm. Donkey carts and horse-drawn carriages plied muddy ruts that passed as roads. The only motorized transport belonged to Western NGOs. Commerce consisted of a few sad huts--primitive convenience stores--and an outdoor bazaar where 90 percent of economic activity came from sales of opium paste. In 2001 I wrote that good roads would change everything. They have. It's impressive. Based on my 2001 experience, I had budgeted three to four days to travel from the Tajik border to Taloqan. Cruising down smooth two-lane highways at 80-plus mph, we made it in half an afternoon. Towers for high-tension conduits line the road, promising an electrified future. The ghosts of 2001 are here--burned-out armored personnel carriers, lumps of earth where villages stood, tank treads used as speed bumps--but hard to find. Khanabad, the blood-soaked eastern front line during the battle of Kunduz--where my fellow journalist had the skin torn off his body by Taliban POWs using their bare hands--is a farm community marked by the kind of green-and-white reflectorized sign you'd see in the Midwest. Most of Taloqan is paved. The soccer field used by the Taliban for stonings and by a Northern Alliance warlord as a helicopter landing pad is filled with kids playing on green grass. There are traffic jams and white-gloved traffic cops direct the mayhem. Business is booming. America is finished, but Taloqan is looking good. But the basics--the social and political situation that in December 2001 prompted me to declare the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan doomed--remain the same. Time magazine recently declared that the Taliban would sweep back into power after a U.S. withdrawal. But the Taliban never left. Neither did the repression. In Taloqan every woman but one wore the burqa, turning her head away as we passed. Where are the Taliban? \"They are all around us,\" said my driver's cousin, the campaign manager for a Canadian-Afghan actor running for parliament next month. \"During the day, it is OK. They come at night.\" Indeed they do. The week before our arrival they stormed a small NATO garrison staffed by German troops at the airport here, killing seven. Cellphone signals go dead at night in deference to Taliban strictures. Afghans are strictly prohibited from receiving foreigners as overnight guests. Only one hotel, the gaudy Ariana Hotel and Wedding Banquet Hall, can accommodate non-Afghans. \"The situation in Taloqan is not good,\" continued the campaign manager. \"At night.\" We have the Ariana entirely to ourselves. Compared to the Spartan conditions we endured nine years ago--bed lice, outhouse guarded by a mean rooster--it's a palace. But it's a gilded cage, one surrounded by high walls topped with barbed wire and guarded by a caffeinated man brandishing an AK-47. We can't go out at night and neither do most Afghans. There's more prosperity. But it's even less safe. And the one thing Afghans wanted most in 2001--security--remains elusive.\n\n8 | AUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | BOISEweekly\n\nWWW. B O I S E WE E KLY. C O M\n\n\u000CNEWS/CITYDESK NEWS\nM IK E FLINN\n\nTHE SUPREMACY OF LAW: JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER SPEAKS IN SUN VALLEY\nThis summer, a lot of important and talented people have touched down in Sun Valley. Steve Martin was masterful as both a comic and a bluegrass banjo bandleader. Itzhak Perlman took a star turn with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony. And Carole King and James Taylor sent the local Baby Boomers into nostalgic ecstasy. Last weekend, the Sun Valley Writers' Conference drew in yet another wave of very important people. But only one had the word \"supreme\" on his business card. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer spent much of his time answering a simple question: What, exactly, does an Associate Justice of the nation's highest court do? Breyer once told his son Michael, \"If you do your homework really well, you can get a job where you can do homework for the rest of your life.\" That's essentially what he does in Washington, D.C., Breyer said. \"Basically I read, and I write.\" Breyer paid homage to the elegance and the genius of our Constitution--that document that \"constitutes\" our democratic government, as he put it. Breyer spun a tale of Cooper v. Aaron, one of his favorite cases. Then-Arkansans Gov. Orval Faubus defied federal law and sent in a militia to block nine black students--the Little Rock Nine--from entering Central High School. A furious President Dwight Eisenhower summoned the rebel Faubus to the presidential summer home in Newport, R.I., and the former supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe dressed the governor down, \"like a general tells a lieutenant,\" Faubus recalled. But back in Arkansas, Faubus remained defiant. At this pivotal moment, faced with allowing the South to rise again or to flex his federal muscle, Eisenhower went full general. He called out Faubus on national television-- \"Federal law ... cannot be flouted with impunity by any individual or any mob of extremists\"--and sent in the 101st Airborne, the heroes of D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, to enforce the ruling. The Little Rock Nine went to school on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 1958, and the rest is Civil Rights history. If Cooper v. Aaron was an easy (or at least unanimous) decision that was difficult to enforce, the more recent drama of 2000's Bush v. Gore demonstrated a tough decision (5-4 for Bush) that was immediately accepted as law. Think about it, Breyer said: \"Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide, but lost in Florida by just 2,000 votes.\" When Gore sought a recount and the Florida Supreme Court obliged, Bush sued. The case reached Breyer's desk, and the rest was history. What was remarkable about it, Breyer said, is that even though \"vast numbers of Americans thought it was wrong,\" and even he himself thought it was wrong, \"people followed it.\" \"In other places, there would have been guns and bullets. The fact that no blood was shed after Bush v. Gore,\" Breyer said, \"is what makes America great. \"It might sound like a Fourth of July speech, but it's a part of my life,\" Breyer said to a closing standing ovation. --Michael Ames\n\nMediation next step between battling Auditorium Board and Visitors Bureau\nTARA MORGAN\nNext time you rent a hotel room in Boise, check out the small print at the bottom of the bill. In addition to room rates, every customer is assessed a 5 percent tax that funds the Greater Boise Auditorium District. GBAD is responsible for building and maintaining the Boise Centre, completed in 1990, and for decades, it has also funded the Boise Convention and Visitors Bureau. Before July 22, few outside of the hospitality industry could have told you what the publicly elected GBAD board does. But after a heated meeting, when the board voted 3-2 to stop funding the BCVB, folks started paying attention. The Visitors Bureau is responsible for bringing more than $30 million to the Boise area through conventions and events like the Special Olympics and the Ironman Triathlon. But come Wednesday, Sept. 1, the bureau will lose $1.3 million in funding from GBAD, approximately 65 percent of its budget. With so much on the line, Mayor Dave Bieter stepped in and offered to pay for mediation. \"There are three people on the board who want to take all of the marketing in house, and there are two of us who want to work with BCVB,\" said GBAD member Mike Fitzgerald. \"It took an intervention by the mayor to get the group ... to come together and try to hammer out some kind of agreement.\" Arguments against funding BCVB have taken various forms. First, board members cited the bureau's recent questionable audit report. Then, they referenced a 2008 Idaho Supreme Court ruling in Pocatello that said auditorium districts can only use hotel taxes to market their own facilities, not the city as a whole. GBAD Board Chairman Mike Wilson acknowledged that the bureau is valuable to Boise but argued that the board can't continue to fund the bureau as it has in the past.\nWWW. B OISEWEEKLY.C O M\n\nFIRST, THE GBAD NEWS\n\"We can't pay them 100 percent of what they do,\" said Wilson, \"because 100 percent of what they do does not affect us in the least ... The Supreme Court case says that I can't spend money that isn't marketing my building. The Visitors Bureau markets a lot of things other than our building, but yet we're paying for it. That's the issue, that's how simple it is.\" But the issue got considerably more complicated when BCVB received a $328,000 grant in early August from the Idaho Travel Council that can be spent on marketing the city but not on bureau salaries. As of now, that means the bureau's 15 employees will have to work probono to utilize the grant money. \"It would be great for us if the district would decide to at least fund us at a level adequate to allow us to do our grant program,\" said Bobbie Patterson, executive director of BCVB. \"That really probably means some reasonable allocation ... Our job is going to be ongoing to sell the city, their job apparently is going to be to sell the [Boise Centre] primarily, which is a whole different challenge.\" Before the GBAD board's vote not to fund the Visitors Bureau, the Boise Centre recruited three BCVB employees to work in house doing marketing for the Boise Centre. But the notion that the 5 percent room tax will now only fund the marketing of the Boise Centre--and not the city's many other meeting and conference facilities--has many hoteliers in a panic. \"I think that decision is pretty devastating for not only the hotel community but certainly our city as a whole,\" said John May, general manager and part-owner of the Owyhee Plaza Hotel. \"Obviously, what the Convention Bureau brings to town goes far wider than just the hotel rooms. It's a trickle-down effect.\" David Hale, owner of the Modern Hotel, also disagrees with the board's decision.\n\n\"Our customers, our guests, are having to pay a percentage of tax that's ultimately going to another entity [the Boise Centre] to help support their business,\" said Hale. \"It isn't possibly helping support the rest of downtown and the rest of Boise like the Convention and Visitors Bureau did. That doesn't seem right. It seems like they should reduce that tax then.\" So what will happen to that $1.3 million if BCVB not longer gets it? Part of it will go toward funding the Boise Centre's in-house marketing and the rest will go into GBAD coffers for the potential construction of another Boise Centre-like facility. \"If we're unable to expand or build a new building in a reasonable period of time, then, yes, I would advocate reducing [the tax],\" said Wilson. Wilson offered a number of suggestions for funding the Visitors Bureau--the City of Boise could spend its money or local hoteliers could pay a fee--but regardless, if mediation fails, BCVB won't be able to support its staff come Sept. 1. In Fitzgerald's eyes, this is a giant step backward for Boise, one that could potentially affect the city's growth for years to come. \"This puts the sales and marketing of Boise and our competition for conventions behind years,\" said Fitzgerald. \"It's going to affect tourism and convention and meeting business in this valley very, very hard.\" But according to Patterson, the bureau remains hopeful that through mediation, which should take place in the coming days or weeks, the GBAD board--and the community at large--will realize the value in what they do. \"We're all prepared to go on unemployment, we're moving our offices ... We're going to try to find some way to stay in place until there's some resolution to the issue,\" said Patterson.\n\nBOISEweekly | AUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | 9\n\n\u000CCITIZEN\n\nTWO MEN, THREE JOBS\nFor whom the school bell tolls\nGEORGE PRENTICE\nWednesday, Aug. 25, as Boise Weekly was hitting the streets, so were the city's school children. In its 147-year history, the 2010-2011 school year may be the Boise School District's most challenging. Facing a growing curriculum and austere budget, the harshest lesson this year may be economics. Dr. Don Coberly is the district's new superintendent, pulling double duty as the district's leader in addition to his role as curriculum coordinator. His deputy is Dr. Pete Bailey, serving the district since 1985. What kind of student were you? Coberly: I think I was an average student. I graduated from Borah High School with a 3.2 average. Do you remember teachers who really inspired you? Coberly: There were three. Dennis Roggenbuck taught me math analysis. He was a very demonstrative active teacher. Bob Firman was a legendary calculus teacher and Elsa Bennett taught me world history. All three were student-centered. By the time I went to the University of Idaho, they had really taught me how to think. How many kids are in Boise public schools this fall? Coberly: 25,200. What is your 2010-2011 budget? Coberly: $188 million. That's down about $12 million from last year.\nJER EM Y LANNINGHAM\n\nDr. Pete Bailey, deputy school superintendant (left), and Dr. Don Coberly, Boise School superintendant (right).\n\nWhat did you have to do to keep the doors open at the Marian Pritchett School, Boise's school for pregnant teens and new mothers? Bailey: We had heard for several years that some legislators intended to cut funding to the school some day. So when those cuts came, we needed to make some serious decisions. We spent a great deal of time examining what changes and what cuts we had to make to keep the school open. And yes, that meant some staff cuts and changes in operations. Coberly: I've got to tell you, I have a difficult time going to the Marian Pritchett graduation each spring. It's so emotional: the poetry, the music, the goodbyes. Tell us about the changes at some of Boise's primary schools. Bailey: Nine elementary schools will have different hours, starting at 9:15 a.m. rather than the traditional 8:45 a.m. The benefit comes from a management of school bus routes that will afford some savings. But how about parents who still have to drop off their children at the earlier time? Bailey: Each principal at the nine schools will have some kind of planned activity that will make up for that time. There will be reading clubs, chess clubs or math clubs.\n\nDo you see this as a permanent change? Bailey: We'll just have to see how this works. I don't see any change back to the earlier time in the near future. What are your biggest financial challenges this year? Coberly: All of our staff will be taking three days of furlough. We cut assistant principals and counselors at three of our four high schools. A number of our supervisory personnel went from full time to half time. And we didn't replace my previous job. (Coberly is still responsible for creation and supervision of the district's curriculum.) Do you have two titles? Coberly: I just have one title, but I have two jobs. And supplies? Coberly: We're not buying any new textbooks. It's our third straight year. What's the risk of doing that? Coberly: You might be able to go four years, but sooner or later, you're an edition behind and that's very critical when it comes to history and science. Teachers are trying to supplement with the Internet but you need a standard text to support your curriculum.\n\n10 | AUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | BOISEweekly\n\nWWW. B O I S E WE E KLY. C O M\n\n\u000CADAM ROSENLUND\n\nhe voices were louder than normal but normal had nothing to do with what happened on July 1. \"They were telling me to stop him,\" said Candice Dahl. \"Stop him from taking my stuff. Stop him from breaking into my room. Just stop him.\" So Dahl listened. She matter-of-factly took out her knife, the serrated one that had protected her for years on the streets of Boise when she was homeless. She walked out of her room, down the hall and into the room of her housemate, Charlie. She didn't say a word. She said Charlie laughed at her. So, she stabbed him. Charlie stared at her. So she stabbed him again. That time, he fell to his bed. Dahl stood over him. \"I stabbed him again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. I think I stabbed him 12 times.\" Boise Police Department's official report indicated Charlie was stabbed no fewer than 18 times. Police said it's a miracle he survived. \"I don't remember what I did with the knife,\" said Dahl, \"but I do know I wanted my smokes. When I was done, I walked outside. I sat on the curb and lit up a cigarette.\" A couple of weeks later, as Dahl told her story, she looked exactly like her mug shot. She didn't blink as she stared right through the double panes of glass that separate her in maximum custody at the Ada County jail from the world that torments her. As chilling as her story is, her words simply don't match her cherubic features. Underneath a bad dye job, her strawberry blond hair and porcelain skin give her the appearance of someone much younger than 29. Who knows what she'll look like when she is released someday from jail or prison or a mental hospital. She expects to be gone for a while. Dahl still dreams of normalcy. She remembers her combination birthday/Valentine's Day parties (she was born Feb. 14, 1981). She remembers how much she used to love music but can't remember the last time she sang even to herself. Someday, she said, she'd like to go to college or possibly cosmetology school. \"I'd love to learn how to make someone's nails pretty.\"\n\nT\n\nHer own are bitten to the quick. Her hands and feet are cuffed at all times in the lockup. She's considered a threat to herself and others. \"Yes, I do have outbursts. I've had to be restrained. I don't remember why.\" With the exception of interviews with BW, Dahl hasn't had any visitors at the jail. Not her mother. Not her brother. Not her housemates. No one. \"I think I got along with pretty much everybody there until they started stealing my stuff.\" \"There\" is a house. Some call it a halfway home. Some call it a group home. It's neither. It's simply a private residence. At first glance, and at second for that matter, it's just like any other home in Boise: A couple of cars in the driveway, and the front lawn is more green than brown. Its west Boise neighborhood has a very familiar look: American flags, sprinklers dousing parched lawns and two young girls running a lemonade stand at the end of the block. But the neighbors know something is up down the street. The yellow crime-scene tape put up on July 1 was just the latest clue. \"One morning, we and our kids woke up, and crime tape had cordoned off our front lawn. I couldn't even pull the car out of the driveway.\" The couple next door agreed to talk to BW but asked to remain anonymous to protect their four children. \"We've lived here long before Mr. Bush bought the house next door, and we still don't know what's going on over there.\" Mr. Bush is Phil Bush, the owner of the house and absentee landlord.\n\nWHEN THINGS NEXT DOOR GO BAD. VERY BAD.\nBY GEORGE PRENTICE\n\"I work with the mentally ill,\" he told BW in a reluctant interview. \"I'm a retired [psycho-social rehabilitation] counselor.\" But Bush doesn't formally counsel residents. They're responsible for getting their own services. \"But, yes,\" said Bush, \"most of my tenants struggle with mental illness.\" Does that mean the house is a group home? \"Nope.\" Is it licensed? \"Nope.\" Bush didn't volunteer much of anything. \"Look. It's a private residence, and I'm renting rooms. There's no code or law, federal--state or city--overseeing my homes.\"\n\nWWW. B OISEWEEKLY.C O M\n\nBOISEweekly |\n\nAUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | 11\n\n\u000CHe's right. In 1995, a watershed U.S. Supreme Court ruling was handed down in the case City of Edmonds, Washington v. Oxford House. The high court ruled that recovering addicts, alcoholics and the mentally ill were a protected class under the handicapped provisions of the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. \"The Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act mean that we're hands-off when it comes to zoning,\" said Bruce Chatterton, Boise's director for Planning and Development Services. \"And federal law trumps everything else. \"We don't even have any real idea where all the group homes are in this city,\" said Chatterton. \"If they're in a single-family neighborhood, we're not going to place any greater restriction on them than any other private residence.\" And that makes Chatterton ill at ease. \"It's very uncomfortable for me to have someone call and ask why they weren't told one of these homes was in their neighborhood. And I have to admit we don't know.\" He paused, \"Maybe we should. But we don't.\" Chatterton also told BW about a troubling broadcast he heard on a Boise radio station. \"About four years ago, there was a local real estate guy saying, `Hey, if you have a house that isn't selling, but want to hang on to it, don't just rent it out to one person. Rent it out to a whole group of persons in recovery. You'll make buckets of money.'\" So how much money does Bush charge his tenants? He gave us a stern, \"No comment.\" When we asked to confirm what two of his\n\nresidents told us--that he charged between $450 and $550 a month per person--Bush thought for a moment. \"I won't say how much I charge. I will say that I provide a room and utilities.\" Bush did confirm that the transactions were cash. One home has six to eight residents at any one time. So, that's an easy $4,000 per month, per home. Residents say Bush is always on time each month to collect the cash. \"By the way, I have four homes,\" Bush volunteered. \"But I don't want you thinking that I do this for the money. I'm retired, but this isn't my only income.\" We asked Bush how his tenants pay the rent. \"It's pretty simple,\" he offered. \"Almost all of them get Social Security because of their mental disability.\" Take Candice Dahl. She's being held in the medical ward of the Ada County Jail. She said she has multiple diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and schizo-affective disorder. Jail staff administer three separate medications to her daily. Dahl said she doesn't recall any physical abuse as a child but said that she endured a fair amount of emotional abuse. \"I just got a letter from my mom,\" Dahl said softly. \"She told me she doesn't know what she could have done to help me.\" Dahl stared silently for what felt like five minutes. \"But if she cared, I wouldn't have ever been homeless.\" Dahl said she was a problem teen. She admits to skipping school, running away and even stealing a car. She was sent to the Juvenile Corrections Center in St. Anthony. And\n\nthen things took a turn for the better. While incarcerated, Dahl completed her GED. Upon release, she studied and passed an exam to become a certified nursing assistant. She said she worked in a few private senior homes in Montana and Idaho and moved back to Boise to live with her mother. Things did not go well. \"She threw me out. She said I was mentally unstable,\" Dahl said. Dahl said she was homeless for a while in Boise, spending time at Interfaith Sanctuary and City Light shelters. \"But they kicked me out, too. They said I'd been fighting and being verbally abusive.\" Dahl said she had heard about the \"Phil Bush house\" for a few years. \"Yeah, a lot of folks on the streets of Boise know about Mr. Bush.\" Bush confirmed that saying, \"Yeah, everybody on the street has pretty much heard of me.\" Well, not everybody. \"Sorry, never heard of him,\" said Treena Clark, program specialist with the Division of Behavior Health for Idaho Health and Welfare. \"But that's not a terrible surprise. There is no obligation in Idaho for any home like his to be certified or licensed. So they're not monitored.\" That's not to say that there aren't licensed facilities in Idaho. Since 1995 when federal funding became available, a handful of homes were classified as \"staffed, safe and sober.\" \"What we discovered was that a person just coming out of jail, or in some kind of recovery, usually runs into financial difficulty. And a major barrier to their success is an unsafe environment,\" said Kathy Skippen, acting program\n\nsupervisor for Health and Welfare's Substance Abuse Disorder Department. \"These homes really shouldn't be run democratically by the residents. And there really should be a number of requirements, including staffing. And there really should be some accountability to the community and to the state of Idaho.\" Clark followed Skippen's thoughts: \"A number of homes really stepped up and desired to be licensed. They provide a setting that has a high degree of safety and an expectation of quality that is being provided.\" No one BW spoke to could say how many homes or facilities are operating in Idaho. But they all guessed it was in the hundreds. Only 36 are licensed and 22 of those are in Boise. \"The criteria is pretty simple. If the home receives any kind of state funding and it is staffed, then they need to be licensed,\" said Clark. \"And that's a good thing. We've found a great deal of success in many of these licensed homes.\" The average cost per client at a licensed, staffed, safe and sober house is about $330 per month. Compare that to $450-$550 residents say they're paying Bush for a room in one of his houses without supervision or services. But Health and Welfare officials say they don't expect homes like Bush's to be licensed anytime soon. \"Idaho is a conservative state,\" said Skippen. \"And I just don't think you're going to find that much appetite for licensing.\" \"But the fact remains that the success rate is much higher when residents have received treatment and recovery support services,\" said Clark.\n\nFREE RIDE!\nKids Eat Free at Smoky's Throughout the Entire Fair * August 20-29\n* Dine in only.

THE VOICES TOLD ME TO.\"\nCandice Dahl's mug shot after being arrested by Boise Police Department for stabbing her roommate at least 18 times on July 1.\n\n\"\n\n\"Many of the owners of these unlicensed homes still want to be good neighbors,\" Clark cautioned. \"Most don't want to cause trouble. But if there are concerns, I would encourage neighbors to contact the owner directly.\" Neighbors said they tried communicating with Bush long before Candice Dahl stabbed her housemate but had no success. So they went to Boise City Hall. \"Yes, I've heard of the house you're referring to,\" said Boise City Council President Maryanne Jordan. \"The neighbors have contacted me on a few occasions, but there is very little, if anything, we can do.\" Jordan also cited the Fair Housing and Americans with Disabilities Acts that prevent discrimination and protect privacy. \"Many of these homes are here for all the right reasons. They provide a stable setting while its residents find a bridge back to society,\" she said. But Jordan said maybe the community is asking the wrong questions. Rather than ask whether there is little oversight of those living in the shadows, ask whether there are appropriate systems of care, safety and prevention? \"Especially at a time when we choose to slash funding for social programs and corrections,\" Jordan said pointedly. \"What's happening to the folks who we're so anxious to release from jail or prison? It's ultimately important to address these complex social issues long before incarceration. What's happening to our prevention programs? What are we doing to nurture and protect the fragile hearts and minds of children and young adults?\" Bush said as a landlord, he's not looking to the future or living in the past. \"Look here, I know these people. I used to work with the mentally ill at a couple of private mental-health agencies,\" Bush said. He wouldn't provide the names of the agencies. \"In many ways, this is the last chance for many of these folks. I've had one resident stay with me for two and a half years.\" But Bush didn't want to talk about Dahl, who clearly required supervision. \"Look, I told you. I'm only the landlord. I drop by when I can.\" Bush told BW he was heading up to Stanley for a \"much-needed vacation.\" We asked if someone could get a hold of him if another crisis erupted. \"If I let them,\" he said. Bush definitely\nWWW. B OISEWEEKLY.C O M\n\nreceived a call on July 1, when Candice Dahl sat outside the home in a blood-soaked shirt. \"Yeah, she was having a bad day. That's all I want to say about that,\" Bush said. There's very little, if any, information that law enforcement will say about Dahl's case. Her arrest file has been heavily redacted due to her pending court hearing, scheduled just as BW was going to press. Boise police will confirm that they responded to a report of a knife fight on July 1. When they arrived, the stabbing victim was rushed to a local hospital, where he survived a minimum of 18 stab wounds. Police collected into evidence a bloodied knife. When they went to arrest Dahl, police say she began running toward an officer with a closed fist. They used a taser, not the stun gun shot from a distance but rather a hand-held device that when placed on someone's shoulder instantly incapacitates them. Dahl fell to the ground, was handcuffed and led away. \"I admit I stabbed Charlie. The voices told me to,\" Dahl said. Does she still hear the voices? Dahl didn't have to think about it long. \"Yeah. Sometimes I can't make out what they're saying. But they're loud. They're really loud.\" Was she hearing some of the voices during our jailhouse visit? \"A little bit.\" In the nearly two months of her incarceration, Dahl said she's undergone a couple of mental examinations. \"They reviewed my meds, and they asked me about my outbursts and the voices in my head. I think they want to send me away.\" Where's \"away?\" \"You know, a mental hospital. I think I would do really well there. I know I can get better.\" Not once did Dahl crack a smile when BW spoke to her during three hour-long visits. Not when she talked about music, not when she talked about a romance novel she was reading, not when she talked about the future. \"I'm going away for a while, it's just a matter of where.\" How about when she's released someday? Again, Dahl didn't blink. \"I don't know. I really don't have anywhere else to go. I guess I'll go back to a different Phil Bush house. But I don't want to go back to the one I was at. They'll steal my stuff. And that would make me angry.\"\n\nBOISEweekly |\n\nAUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | 13\n\n\u000CBOISEvisit boiseweekly.com for more events WEEKLY PICKS\n\nThe Nuge pretends not to see the resemblance.\n\nIs this history-loving teen Ted Nugent's love child?\n\nFRIDAY AUG. 27\ncat scratch fever\nTED NUGENT\nOn the cover of Ted Nugent's most recent album, 2007's Love Grenade, is a picture of a naked women with her arms tied behind her back and a grenade in her mouth.

Look deeper and Sarah McLachlan's latest release, Laws of Illusion, is about heartbreak and the dissolution of her 11-year marriage. Through 12 tracks, with plenty of vocal hooks underscored by catchy instrumental riffs, the Canadian singer-songwriter weaves a common theme that dances through some lyrical cliches with a smoothness that almost makes them sound fresh. She transitions poignant lyrics from \"Illusion of Bliss\": \"Here I go again ... back into your arms / Whatever happened to resolve? For though I thought that I was strong, that I could carry on / Awash in the illusion of this bliss.\" Into stock imagery: \"Here I go again ... back into the flame / Like a moth so willing to be burned.\" McLachlan captures the essence of a shattered relationship throughout the album, crystallizing it on tracks like \"Don't Give Up On Us,\" and \"Heartbreak.\" There are deep emotions here, heartfelt and honest though masked by the beauty of the voice singing them. On the surface, the song titles would suggest hope. They are, perhaps, a catharses for the reality and pain felt instead. Laws of Illusion is McLachlan's seventh studio album, 20th album release overall and a solid offering. There is no overt bitterness here--just the sweet sound of a clear voice that soothes while lyrically provoking deeper thought. Those familiar with McLachlan's work will find little, sound-wise, amiss here. --Michael Lafferty WWW. B O I S E WE E KLY.

For Jeeter (Rod Wolfe) the ghosts are his constant rehashing of the '60s as a history professor. Ben (Kevin Labrum) faces them more literally with visits from a non-corporeal corporal who addresses Ben as Vietnam-era Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The war buddies' relaxing summer disintegrates with the death of Ben's father and a visit from Jeeter's new girlfriend, Salyer, and her mother Lorraine. Ben just wants to be left alone, but he does nothing to achieve that. Additionally, Labrum's portrayal is more whimsical than brooding, even when he's raging at Salyer about what the '60s were \"really like.\" Jeeter on the other hand, stalks The Rolling Stones, flies off the handle and occasionally locks up mid-sentence. Until we find out mid-play that he's still a professor, the impression is that he's mentally ill, making it a stretch to imagine him lording over a classroom. When Salyer and Lorraine enter the picture, conversations far too intimate for the situation ensue with implausible ease. Both women are also facing personal Vietnam-induced traumas that come to a messy head alongside Ben and Jeeter's. Through it all, nothing is on the line dramatically. Ben wants nothing, so he has nothing to lose. Jeeter could lose Salyer-- who is only along for the ride as she searches for herself--but he hasn't known her long and he sees everything else in his life as perfect and bulletproof. Lorraine offers some bitterly comic one-liners but her presence is more as a foil than for the sake of the character. Overall, The Last of the Boys has good dialogue, decent acting and solid presentation, but until the middle of the second act, when Ben and Jeeter start slinging brutal war truths at each other, the situation wasn't very compelling. It was less about the characters than it was political talking points about Vietnam ... points that have been made many times in many ways. After the play, two women said they were moved by the portrayal of how war leaves people broken in ways that aren't visible to the naked eye. I got that. But, alone, that they were broken wasn't enough to make the story truly engaging. --Josh Gross\n\nCalls to Artists\nFOUR AND SIX-MONTH RESIDENCIES FOR AIR--Up to seven artists will be chosen for rent-free studio spaces in downtown.

The stimulative power of girl groups has been clear throughout economic history. France and Italy, which in the early 1960s were still emerging from postwar depressions, made smart, targeted investments in the ye-ye movement, producing international sensations such as the tireless pixie France Gall and the boyish sparkplug Rita \"The Mosquito\" Pavone. During that decade, France's economy grew by a factor of 2.3, according to the World Bank. Italy went from having the world's seventh to having the world's fifth largest economy, leapfrogging China and Canada. Why didn't the United States see that kind of growth during the '60s boom? America entered the decade with a hearty complement of girl singers--the Chantels, the Shirelles and the Ronettes, to name a few--but soon lost interest in these acts in favor of a self-styled \"invasion\" of boy groups from socialist, girl-groupless Britain. Broadly speaking, girl groups correlate with economic expansion, boy bands with stagnation. We went off the girl standard before France did. The Girl Group Effect became more pronounced as Girl Group 1.0 evolved into a second wave of all-female bands. The Go-Go's fueled the recovery from the early 1980s recession, while the onset of the 1990 recession coincided with the breakup of the Bangles. The effect was strongest in the 1990s. U.S. productivity grew at a whopping 1.7 percent per year for the first half of the decade, while the nascent riot grrrl movement--a nebulous grouping of feminist all-female punk bands--gave rise to such standouts as Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney. NAFTA allowed the free exchange of angry Canuck songstress Alanis Morissette. Britain maintained low inflation and low unemployment while outperforming the Eurozone countries in GDP growth, thanks both to economic liberalization and to the rise of the Spice Girls. This last boom--the 1990s--is the subject of a breezy and long-overdue study in Marisa Meltzer's Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music (Macmillan). Girl Power eschews cutting-edge economic theory, instead charting the histories of various partially intersecting trends during a decade when popular music was blessed by an explosion of female acts. Like everything now, the book is also a memoir, showing the author's transformation from a sloganeering teenage riot grrrl into a grown\nWWW. B OISEWEEKLY.C O M\n\nwoman wondering what it all meant. Meltzer takes a broad view of a landscape that at the time seemed immensely balkanized, with minor stylistic misinterpretations (were the Lunachicks riot grrrls or queercore punkers?) liable to get you into serious trouble. She claims her heart is with the riot grrrl movement, privileging that group's view over those of either\n\naging-boomer Lilith Fair acolytes or a music movement Meltzer mostly regrets--the late '90s \"pop tart invasion\" of girl acts packaged by major labels. Meltzer tries to stay above these pointless mod/rocker distinctions, but riot grrrl was a pop fad with more direct meanings than most. A lot of the import was musical, with a DIY, anti-produced sound that yielded masterpieces like Bratmobile's \"Cool Schmool,\" an exact replica of original 1970s punk (the '90s were great for exact replicas) that has been mellowed by time and sorrow into a perfect miniature. But the major meaning was political. Paying riot grrrl dues involved mastering a\n\nwitty and aggressive style of feminism, ranting in a 'zine about the rapist society or the phallocentric late-capitalist culture trust and making a serious commitment to detournement. (If you were getting your news from the misogynistic culture industry back then, you will remember the trope about formerly sweet American girls writing \"SLUT\" on their bellies, thankfully never with anything more permanent than a Sharpie.) The political ethos was best explained by the accordionist, zine-stress and fat liberationist Nomy Lamm, speaking in 1999 with Paul Allen's Experience Music Project: \"I never had feminism presented to me in any way that was interesting at all. Like, all I knew about feminism was that it was, like, you can then work in a corporation and get paid the same amount as a man.\" Meltzer's goal is to teach girls not to \"fixate on the individual\" but \"band together\" for \"real power.\" She considers some pretty Venezuelan means toward that end, wondering if we should \"simply recruit women to start playing music at a younger and more impressionable age.\" So why does she struggle to confess her love for the band with the most superbly crafted group dynamic of all? The Spice Girls, she snorts, \"were preconceived and prepackaged.\" Yet the very quality the era's hipsters mocked-- their air of cheerful solidarity--made the Spice Girls' version of girl power plausible. The idea that women are all one big team runs through their breakout hit \"Wannabe\" and their movie Spice World, in the course of which the girls take a break from plot advancement to help out a pregnant friend--just the kind of thing you would not expect to see in A Hard Day's Night. In those early days of the Internet singularity, it seemed possible that advanced communications might create a functioning female hive mind, a prospect Geri \"Ginger Spice\" Halliwell broached when she ridiculed the inability of \"male-dominated newspapers to realize that five women in short skirts have got a brain.\" Inevitably, on the cusp of middle age, Meltzer makes her peace at a 2008 Spice Girls reunion concert, accepting that there may be some value in the nonpolitical empowerment the free market affords. I would look at the options 2010 offers to girls, who with few exceptions are outperforming boys in the acquisition of life skills, and take it further than that. Girl power needs the market as much as the market obviously needs girl power. Enough with the green infrastructure stimulus. Only girl groups can save America now.

I didn't know--I was at the fair judging the Colgate Country Showdown sponsored by WOW 104.3--so I called Kristine, the marketing and entertainment director for Land of Rock, the pavilion's promoter. She wasn't at the show either (she was up in Donnelly watching Blues Traveler) but she said when she checked in with staff the next day, they said everything--and everyone--was fine. \"Shows have to end by 10 p.m. out there,\" Simoni said. \"My staff said by the time the wind really picked up, John Prine was off the stage, all of the patrons had gone and the only people left were security and the local team from Sand Hollow Productions.\" The team had gotten the stage torn down before the 65-mph-plus gusts hit. Visit landofrock.com for info on upcoming concerts. What is the Colgate Country Showdown you ask? Each year, the toothpaste giant holds a singing competition in search of the next LeAnn Rimes or Keith Urban. Country music radio stations across America sponsor the contest, with finalists moving on to state, regional and then national finals. Representing Idaho and moving on to the regional competition in Utah is sultry voiced young Amber Pollard, whose gutsy rendition of Wynonna Judd's \"No One Else on Earth\" secured her spot. My fellow judges--Idaho Live's Joy Hart and the DBA's Morgan Cole--and I had a difficult time narrowing down the 12 contestants to one, but after much deliberation we were happy to send Pollard off to represent Idaho.

Bigtime bands from across the countr y will gather for this year's show, aptly entitled the Carnival of Madness. Music comes courtesy of Shinedown, Buckcherry, Chevelle, Puddle of Mudd, Sevendust, Drowning Pool, 10 Years and Seasons After. Even a local band will be joining the craziness: Emmett-based The Forgotten won a coveted opening spot during The X's Local Cage Match when listeners voted them in. Along with all the music, there will be an autograph booth and live broadcasts all day. The madness starts when the gates are flung open at 2:30 p.m. and you can still win tickets by tuning in to 100.3 The X. No backpacks, no cameras and no outside food or drink. One nonfrozen bottle of water per person is OK. --Molly Kumar 3:30 p.m., $39.50.

Some people consider DMB the master of mediocre while others heed his siren call--or 25-minute songs as it were--to the annual DMB weekend at the Gorge. Regardless of how you feel about Matthews' music, it's kind of a big deal to be able to see the man of a million jams right here at home. Pollstar.com says that \"not only is DMB one of the biggest touring acts in the world, but the group is also the No. 1 touring band of the past 10 years, selling 11.6 million tickets from 1999 to 2009 and taking in $529.1 million at the turnstiles.\" During this summer of serenading, DMB recently played a free concert at a Utah venue to make up for cancelling a 2009 show there. Clearly, one free show isn't going to break Matthews, but it's still a generous gesture. --Amy Atkins With Alberta Cross, 7 p.m., $45-$65. Taco Bell Arena, 1910 University Dr., tacobellarena.com.

Schneider is not afraid to trust the shadows when framing his scenes, beckoning the audience for a closer look. Put Schneider on a short list of filmmakers whose best work is in front of him. Get Low is as authentic as it is entertaining. Costume designer Julie Weiss perfectly balances the haves and the have-nots of 1930s Tennessee. And the soundtrack is tons of fun with the likes of \"If I Didn't Care\" and \"My Blue Heaven\" joined by a new recording of \"Lay My Burden Down\" by Alison Krauss. Get Low is a wonderfully original American yarn. And it burns like an aged blend of Tennessee tobacco with a pungent taste of drama cut by a sweet aroma of comedy.\n\nSCREEN/LISTINGS\nSpecial Screenings\nSTAY GOLD--Premiere of a new film from Emerica Skate Shoes, including sessions from pros Leo Romero, Heach Kirchart, Andrew Reynolds and more.

Silky smooth in the mouth, the flavors are fruit forward and are highlighted by blackberry and slightly tart cherry. The finish lingers nicely with the softest of tannins and just a slight hint of chocolate. 2007 LINCOURT, $24 The aromas on this California classic are big and bold and filled with ripe cherry and cranberry fruit backed by floral lilac, basil and earthy touches of mushroom and spice. Beautifully balanced in the mouth, it has lots of juicy cherry, plum and ripe berry fruit flavors with just the right hit of acidity. The tannins are supple and plush on the finish, which lingers nicely. 2006 REX HILL RESERVE, $33 Old world aromas of earth and mushroom mark this Oregon entry and blend nicely with bright plum, dark cherry, green tea and herb. This is a supple, well-structured wine with deliciously deep and dark fruit flavors. It coats the palate with ripe raspberry and cherry, colored by anise, mocha and spice.

In 1899, 4 bed/3.5 bath George Vaughn subdivided 3,488 square feet Group One his land and on this corner Eva Hoopes, 208-284-7732 lot, erected a fine Queen boisebeautiful.com Anne residence designed by MLS #98433492 architects Tourtellotte and Hummel, who also designed the State Capitol. At least 56 Tourtellotte and Hummel residences within Ada County are on the National Register of Historic Places (although this one is not). From the stately columns on the wrap-around porch and the original leaded glass windows to the ornately carved interior window and door casings, the 112-year-old dwelling exudes timeless elegance. A recent three-story addition added a basement family room, gourmet kitchen and upper bedroom to the original two-level structure. Leaded glass cabinets from the old kitchen were reused in the laundry room. On the main level the formal dining room can be closed off by a sturdy pocket door and a pair of French doors. An eye-catching antique coal stove in the parlor radiates warmth into the living room. The upper floor contains three bedrooms and a full bathroom, where a long oak buffet has been repurposed as a lovely vanity cabinet topped with slab granite. Outside, the original dairy barn is now a two-car garage and the back yard is shaded by mature maple trees. Pros: Elegant Queen Anne home designed by Tourtellotte and Hummel. Cons: Three-story floor plan impractical for people with limited mobility. --Jennifer Hernandez Open House: Saturday, Aug. 28, 2-4 p.m. LINE ADS: Monday, 10 a.m. DISPLAY: Thursday, 3 p.m.\n* Some special issues and holiday issues may have earlier deadlines.\n\nBW COMMERCIAL\nVIEW OF THE FOOTHILLS 340 sq .ft. office space with view of Boise Foothills available for month to month rent. $325/mo., util. paid. $20 deposit.

Why is it up to you to pick up the slack when others are suffering from laziness and incompetence? And why should you be the fearless leader who is focused on fixing the glitches and smoothing over the rough patches when no one else seems to care? I'll tell you why, Aries: because it's the Karmic Correction phase of your longterm cycle--a time when you can atone for past mistakes, pay off old debts, and make up for lessthan-conscientious moves you got away with once upon a time. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): \"What is the source of our first suffering?\" wrote philosopher Gaston Bachelard. \"It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.\" Luckily for you, Taurus, the cosmic rhythms are aligned in such a way as to free you from some of that old suffering in the coming weeks. I expect that you will have more power than usual to express a part of you that has been buried too long. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): More than 2,000 people have climbed to the top of Mt. Everest, and 12 men have walked on the moon. But only two humans have ever ventured to the lowest spot on our planet. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and Donald Walsh rode in a bathyscaphe all the way down to the Mariana Trench, which is almost seven miles beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Your assignment in the coming weeks, Gemini, is to move in their direction, metaphorically speaking. In my astrological opinion, ascending and soaring shouldn't be on your agenda. It's time to dive into the mysterious depths. CANCER (June 21-July 22): I propose that we do to Mercury what astronomers did to Pluto in 2006: demote it. After all, it's smaller than both Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Who wants to bestow the majestic title of \"planet\" on such a peewee? Let's make the change now, just in time for Mercury's retrograde phase, which began recently. That way we won't have to get all riled up about the supposedly disruptive effects this portends. How could a runt like Mercury stir up any kind of meaningful ruckus? I hereby declare you free and clear of the whole Mercury retrograde superstition. Please proceed on the assumption that between now and September 12 will be an excellent time to deepen and refine your communication with anyone you care about. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): A Chinese company reached out to me by e-mail. \"Dear Sir,\" the message began, \"As the leading professional conveyor belt manufacturers in Shanghai, we present to you our very best sincere regards, desiring to find out if there is a chance for us to be your top-rate conveyor belt supplier.\" I wrote back, thanking them for their friendly inquiry. I said that I didn't have any need of conveyor belts right now, but I would check with my Leo readers to see if they might. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you're entering a time when it makes sense to expand and refine your approach to work. It'll be a good time to get more efficient and step up production. Do you need any conveyor belts? VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Our sun doesn't have a name. \"Sun\" is a generic term that can refer to any of trillions of stars. So I'd like to propose that you come up with a name for it. It could be a nickname or a title, like \"Big Singer\" or \"Aurora Rex\" or \"Joy Shouter\" or \"Renaldo.\" I hope this exercise will get you in the mood to find names for a whole host of other things in your life, like the mysterious feelings that are swirling around inside you, your longings for experiences that don't exist yet and your dreams about the elusive blessings you want so bad. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): The odometer will turn over soon, metaphorically speaking. The big supply of the stuff you stocked up on a while back is about to run out. The lessons you began studying a year ago have been completed, at least for now, and you're not yet ready for the next round of teachings. These are just some of the indicators that suggest you should set aside time for reflection and evaluation. The world may come pounding at your door, demanding that you make a dramatic declaration or take decisive action, but in my opinion you should stall. You need to steep in this pregnant pause. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Most discussions on TV news shows involve so-called experts shouting simplistic opinions. They may provide some meager entertainment value but are rarely enlightening. In contrast to these spectacles were the salons at Paris' Cafe Guerbois in 1869. A group of hard-working artists and writers gathered there to inspire each other. Claude Monet wrote that their discussions \"sharpened one's wits, encouraged frank and impartial inquiry, and provided enthusiasm that kept us going for weeks ... One always came away feeling more involved, more determined, and thinking more clearly and distinctly.\" That's the kind of dynamic interaction you should seek out in abundance, Scorpio. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): In the movies I've seen that depict battle scenes from hundreds of years ago, every army has numerous soldiers whose job it is to carry festive flags and pennants. If this is an accurate depiction of history, what does it mean? That powerful symbols were crucial to inspiring the troops' heroic efforts? That touches of color and beauty lifted their morale? That they were more inclined to do their best if inspired to imagine they were participating in an epic story? Whether or not my theories apply to what actually happened back then, they apply to you now. As you go forth to fight for what you believe in, bring your equivalent of an evocative emblem. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Using a radio telescope, astronomers at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy have been scanning the center of the galaxy. They're looking for evidence of amino acids that could be the building blocks of life. So far their hunt has been inconclusive. But they've stumbled upon an even more appealing discovery: The huge dust cloud at the heart of the Milky Way, they say, tastes like raspberries and smells like rum. That's the kind of switcheroo I predict for you in the upcoming weeks, Capricorn. You may not locate the smoking gun but in the process of searching, I bet you'll hook up with something even better. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Each one of us is a blend of life and death. In the most literal sense, our bodies always contain old cells that are dying and new cells that are emerging as replacements. From a more metaphorical perspective, our familiar ways of seeing and thinking and feeling are constantly atrophying, even as fresh modes emerge. Both losing and winning are woven into every day; sinking down and rising up; shrinking and expanding. In any given phase of our lives, one or the other polarity is usually more pronounced. But for you in the foreseeable future, Aquarius, they will be evenly balanced. Welcome to the Season of Rot and Regeneration. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Allure magazine sought out Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez, the women who wrote the book Perfumes: The A to Z Guide. \"What are the sexiest-smelling perfumes of all time?\" they asked. Turin and Sanchez said Chinatown was at the top of their list. Their explanation: \"If wearing Opium is like walking around with a bullhorn shouting, `Come and get it!', Chinatown is like discreetly whispering the same thing.\" The Chinatown approach is what I recommend for you in the coming weeks, Pisces.\n\n38 | AUGUST 25\uFFFD31, 2010 | BOISEweekly\n\nWWW.
