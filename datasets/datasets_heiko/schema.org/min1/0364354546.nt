Current and former players, as well as their families, came together to celebrate the past and look toward a bright future for Stetson Women's Soccer. Many former Hatters were in attendance, including members of the first team in program history (1993 season). An Alumni Game, a Green/White scrimmage for current players, a lot of great food, and an announcement of the 20th Anniversary Team were all a part of the festivities. \"It's a new beginning for Stetson Soccer,\" Head Coach Julie Orlowski said. \"We have a new facility and a lot of new people coming into the program. Before we look forward we have to pay homage to the past, and show respect for those people who came before us. That's what this event is all about. It's very important for this generation of players to realize what the players before them did so that the current players can have the opportunities that they have now. It's the alumni that laid the foundation for the future of Stetson Women's Soccer.\" Stetson Women's Soccer 20th Anniversary Team Emma Astrom (2000-03) Katie Bitetto (2007-10) Kellie Cashion (1993-96) April Eilering (2003-06) Melissa Engle (1994-97) Tessa Gavilsky (2007-10) Alexis Hermosa (2008-11) Brittany Jones (2003-06) Kelsey Kramer (2004-07) Kelly Kuenning (2002-06) Carrie Lorenz (2001-04) Kristy Porcelli (1996-99) Alisa Richter (1993-96) Genevieve Roy (1997-2000) Sarah Stock (2004-07) Melissa Streeter (1993-96) Ashley Temple (1994-97) Melissa This (1994-97) Sylvia Vigil (1993-96) Emily Yero (2006-09)\n\n@StetsonWSoccer\n\n2\n\n\u000CStetson Hatters Women's Soccer Stetson Women's Soccer 2012 Schedule\nDay Fri.

Stetson returns 10 letterwinners and five starters from a team that improved as the year went on in 2011. Three of the Hatters' four victories came in the back half of the schedule against Atlantic Sun Conference opponents. With a number of key contributors returning the fold in 2012, Stetson will look to return to the A-Sun Tournament for the ninth time in 10 years after missing out on the playoffs due to tie breaker rules last season. Senior Kaisi Hartwick and sophomore Colleen O'Kennedy lead a strong crop of midfielders for the Hatters in 2012. Hartwick, the lone senior on this young Stetson squad, is one that all of the players look at to lead in the midfield. With 30 starts in her career, she has the experience needed for the role. O'Kennedy's talents were recognized by the league's coaches last season, as she was an All-Atlantic Sun honoree as a freshman. The central midfielder can take over a game at any point, and will work harder than anyone else on the field. Junior transfer Amber Grose will add depth and experience to the midfield after playing 25 games in two seasons at USF. Colleen's twin sister Katie O'Kennedy led Stetson in scoring a season ago, but will be redshirting this fall due to injury. Two of the Hatters' other leading scorers from 2011 will return to lead the offense this season. Juniors Alyssa Welsh and Kait Jones scored four goals and three goals, respectively, as sophomores. The former added three assists, while the latter finished with one helper on the season. The pair will receive help up top from junior transfer Alexis Trybinski. A junior college All-American the past two seasons, the speedy forward comes to Stetson Atlantic Sun Conference Preseason Coaches Poll after a successful career at Southwestern Illinois College.

Orlowski, who started programs at St. Thomas, North Florida and Boise State, was named the Hatters' second women's soccer head coach on July 20, 2001. Under her leadership, Stetson reached the A-Sun Tournament every year from 2003-2010 and to the A-Sun title match in 2006. The 2011 team went through a rebuilding campaign but managed to be in contention for an A-Sun tourney berth into the last day of the season despite having to get 73 starting assignments from freshmen and without a returning goalkeeper. Her 2010 squad won eight matches and reached the semifinals of the A-Sun tournament as the #6 seed after winning a quarterfinal match on the road against third-seeded North Florida. In 2009 she led the Hatters to 11 wins and a #3 seed in the A-Sun tournament. The Hatters finished the regular season just one point shy of the #1 spot. It was the third time since Orlowski took over the program, and the fourth time all-time that Stetson finished with double-digit victories. In 2008 Orlowski solidified her status as a top-tier Division I head coach by earning her 100th career victory with a 2-0 win over Lipscomb on October 19. Well respected among her peers in college soccer, Orlowski was a member of the NCAA Regional Advisory Committee from 2006-2008. In 2009 she was honored further with an appointment to a five-year term on the NCAA National Advisory Committee. In 2006, Orlowski led Stetson to perhaps the school's most successful season, earning both A-Sun Coach of the Year and NISOA's Central Florida Orlowski's Year-by-Year Record Coach of the Year honors. The Hatters matched a school record for wins (12) and posted the best regular season conference record (7-1-1) in the program's Year School Record history. The team put together and 8-match unbeaten streak and reached St. Thomas 3-13-1 the conference tournament finals. Addtionally, four players earned first team 1992 all-conference recognition with April Eilering earning Defensive Player of the 1993 St. Thomas 7-6-0 Year. 1994 St. Thomas 8-5-1 In 2005, the Hatters recorded seven shutouts, including five of their 1996 North Florida 10-7-1 last six opponents. Stetson made its second semifinal appearance in three at1998 Boise State 5-11-1 tempts where it forced the match into penalty kicks after a double-overtime 1999 Boise State 6-12-0 scoreless tie. 2001 Stetson 4-13-0 While shutting out six opponents in 2004, Orlowski's squad set new Stetson 6-11-0 school records with a 0.97 goals against average and allowing opponents a 2002 total of just 17 goals. 2003 Stetson 11-7-3 After accumulating a 10-24 record during her first two years at Stet- 2004 Stetson 5-6-5 son, Orlowski led the Hatters to an impressive 11-7-3 mark in 2003 along with 2005 Stetson 9-11-1 a conference championship appearance for just the third time in the program's 2006 Stetson 12-8-1 history. 2007 Stetson 8-10-1 During her first nine years at Stetson, Orlowski has coached 21 2008 Stetson 7-10-2 all-conference performers including nine first team, six second team, and six Stetson 11-7-2 all-freshmen team members along with the league's first-ever Defensive Player 2009 of the Year in Emma Astrom and the school's first Freshman Player of the Year 2010 Stetson 8-11-1 in April Eilering. In 2006, Eilering became Stetson's second Defensive Player of 2011 Stetson 4-11-2 the Year. In 2010 Astrom was inducted into the Stetson Athletics Hall of Fame. Totals 123-140-22 She is the first women's soccer player to earn that honor.\n\nwww.GoHatters.com\n\n5\n\n\u000CStetson Hatters Women's Soccer\n\nCoaching Staff\n\nIn 2009 Tessa Gavilsky once again added to the trophy case after being voted the A-Sun's Offensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. In 2008 she was the first Stetson player ever to earn that honor. Additionally, Orlowski has coached countless Academic All-Conference performers and routinely places more than 75% of her roster on that prestigious list. A 1991 graduate of Florida International University (B.A., Mass Communication), Orlowski came to Stetson following one season as an assistant at South Florida. Prior to her stint at USF, Orlowski compiled a 39-54-4 record in six seasons as a collegiate head coach. Orlowski began Boise State's program in 1997 and previously started the program at North Florida, beginning a club team in 1995 and turning the Ospreys into a nationally ranked Division II program in their first year at the varsity level. In 1996, North Florida was ranked as high as No. 8 during the season. Orlowski began her coaching career at Miami's St. Thomas University in 1992, beginning the NAIA program from scratch just one year after graduating from FIU. She compiled an 18-24-2 record in three seasons at St. Thomas, including winning seasons in 1993 (7-6-0) and 1994 (8-5-1). As a player at FIU, Orlowski was a four-year starter and team captain for the Golden Panthers. She earned her master's in Sports Administration from St. Thomas in 1995. Orlowski holds a United States Soccer Federation \"B\" License and also serves as a part-time instructor for the USSF. She is a state coach for the Florida Youth Soccer Association and has served as an Olympic Development Program instructor.\n\nS t e p h a n i e W E B B\nAssistant Coach | First Year | Stetson, 2009\nFormer Hatter Stephanie Webb was announced as the Stetson Women's Soccer Assistant Coach on Monday, July 16, 2012. Webb comes to DeLand after a recent stint as an assistant coach at Central Michigan. She joined the Chippewa staff prior to the 2010 season, and helped lead them to two stellar seasons. Webb had a multitude of responsibilities at CMU, which included training, scheduling, and acting as the recruiting coordinator. In 2010, Central Michigan finished with a 16-5-1 record, becoming one of two teams to win 10 conference games and earn 30 points since the MAC went to an 11-game format. CMU earned its second straight MAC regular season and tournament championship, while garnering the second NCAA tournament berth in as many seasons. In her second season with the Chippewas, Webb helped the team post their best winning percentage in program history, as the team finished 15-3-3 for a mark of .783. During both seasons with CMU, the Chippewas claimed the nation's top grade point average with marks of 3.76 in 2010 and 3.70 in 2011. Prior to working with Central Michigan, Webb spent the previous year as the Technical Academy Director of the Palm Harbor Soccer Club. She organized training sessions, advised head coaches in their development, and put together plans for the entire U9 - U15 girls program. Webb, who earned her Master of Science in Sports Administration from Central Michigan in 2012, received her Bachelor's degree at Stetson back in 2009. The former forward played two seasons with the Hatters after transferring from Texas A&M International. She appeared in 25 matches, started six contests, and tallied three assists at Stetson. In 29 contests for TAMIU, she racked up 16 goals and a total of 36 points. After finishing her playing career in 2008, Webb stayed on at Stetson as an intern with the soccer program for the rest of her time as a student. She assisted with training sessions, organization of recruiting visits, academic support, and the program's day-to-day operations. Since June of 2009, Webb has been able to stay in the Hatter family as a striker coach for Stetson's Elite Camps. Webb holds a UEFA B Part 2 Coaching Badge, an NSCAA National Diploma, and is an FYSA state staff coach.\n\n@StetsonWSoccer\n\n6\n\n\u000CStetson Hatters Women's Soccer\n\nRoster\n\nNo. 00 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 27 28 30 88\n\nName Victoria Troccoli Laura Seletos Colleen O'Kennedy Amber Grose Autumn Matthews Franziska Wendel Alexis Trybinski Katie O'Kennedy Kristen Mueller Mara Keomanivane Kait Jones Jorje Pierce Kaisi Hartwick Katherine McConnell Carmen Bernecker Jenna Premo Caroline Hurckes Alyssa Welsh Makesha Lucien Rebecca Oser Alex Stanojev Grace Sager Virginia Davis Mattie Stubbs Danielle Hurme Jane Ketcham Amanda Copfer Amber Law\n\nPos.

Women's Soccer\n\nAdministration\n\nStetson University entered a new era of leadership in July 2009 when Dr. Wendy B. Libby became the university's ninth president. Along with Director of Athletics Jeff Altier, Libby was integral in bringing football back to Stetson for the first time since 1956. The Hatters will play their first season in the fall of 2013. Coming with the return of football was the construction of a state-of-the-art field house for not only football, but also men's and women's soccer and the brand new women's lacrosse team. The $6.7 million, 25,000 square foot facility was completed in August of 2012. Formerly president of Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., the nation's second-oldest women's institution, Libby has had a broad career in higher education and private industry. An expert in strategic planning, she plans to build on Stetson's values-centered heritage and tradition of academic excellence and communityengaged service learning while movingStetson forward. Prior to her six years at Stephens College, Libby served as vice president for business affairs and chief financial officer at Furman University, Greenville, S.C., from 1995 to 2003. She has 28 years of administrative and teaching experience in higher education, at institutions including Westbrook College (now part of the University of New England), the University of Hartford, the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, The Ohio State University and Cornell University. A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Libby earned her doctorate in Educational Administration from the University of Connecticut. Her undergraduate degree, in Biology with a concentration in Genetics, is from Cornell University. She earned an MBA, with a concentration in Finance, from Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management. Libby is a member of numerous higher education organizations. Last fall, she led a delegation of six college presidents in a visit to Ewha University in Seoul, South Korea. In honor of her outstanding leadership, Libby received the 2007 Athena Award from the Columbia (Mo.) Chamber of Commerce Women's Network for her support of women in realizing their full leadership potential and for contributing to the quality of life in the communi ty. In May, she received the 2009 Outstanding Higher Education Professional Alumni Award at the University of Connecticut. She and her husband, Dr. Richard M. Libby, have two sons, Glenn and wife Ginger, and Gregg and wife Lori, four grandchildren, a great-granddaughter, and three dogs. An avid reader, she enjoys cooking and entertaining.\n\nDr. Wendy LIBBY\nUniversity President Fourth Year\n\nJeff Altier, a 28-year veteran of the Stetson University athletic department, is in his 16th year as Director of Athletics. During his tenure, Altier has earned a reputation as an outstanding fundraiser and a leader with an eye on the future, and is noted for his active participation in the NCAA governance structure. Along with President Libby, he was integral in bringing football back to Stetson for the first time since 1956. The Hatters will play their first season in the fall of 2013. Coming with the return of football was the construction of a state-of-the-art field house for not only football, but also men's and women's soccer and the brand new women's lacrosse team. The $6.7 million, 25,000 square foot facility was completed in August of 2012. Altier, captain of the nationally-ranked 1982 Hatter baseball team, earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stetson. Upon wrapping up his Stetson baseball career, he spent two years as a player/coach developing the sport in Perth, Australia. He then returned to Stetson as an assistant coach before being promoted to Ticket Manager, Director of Athletic Promotions, and then Associate Athletic Director. In these rolls, he spearheaded the department's development efforts as well as oversaw athletic marketing and promotions, concessions and travel coordination. He was named Director of Athletics in 1996. Altier also served as Tournament Manager for the NCAA Division I Southeast First and Second Round Men's basketball tournament hosted by Stetson in 1993 and 1996 at the Orlando Arena, and as Tournament Director for the 1999 and 2004 tournament. Stetson has taken great strides in the area of gender equity under Altier, increasing scholarships, participation opportunities and staffing for women's athletics. The unprecedented success of the women's tennis, golf, soccer, basketball and softball teams in conference competition during Altier's tenure are evidence of his commitment to women's athletics. In fact, under his direction Stetson's women's and men's teams have won an impressive 15 conference championships. A hallmark of Altier's professional career was the building of Stetson's $4.5 million baseball facility, Melching Field at Conrad Park. Built in conjunction with the City of DeLand, Melching Field is regarded as one of the nation's premiere college baseball facilities. Altier then turned his attention to construction of an on-campus softball facility, which broke ground in 2002 and was ready for competition in February of 2003. The Patricia Wilson Field has been named Collegiate Softball Field of the Year four times. He was also instrumental in securing new state-of-the-art field lighting for both the softball and soccer fields in 2005. Under his guidance, the Athletic Department has seen the addition of the new Wilson Athletic Center, a $ 1.5 million health and wellness facility for the use of Stetson studentathletes. Stetson athletics has continued to grow under Altier's guidance. Three new sports have or will be added in the next year, with sand volleyball starting competition in the spring of 2012, women's lacrosse in the spring of 2013 and the return of football in the fall of 2013. The program is also growing in terms of staffing and facilities, with construction currently under way on a facility that will house the football, lacrosse and both soccer programs, along with practice field for football and practice and game fields for soccer and lacrosse. Altier's leadership has extended beyond campus, as he has taken on Atlantic Sun Conference leadership roles, chairing many committees and serving as conference vice-president. Additionally, he has served on the National Association of College Directors of Athletics Division IAAA board of directors, the NCAA A.E.C. Cabinet and is currently a member of the prestigious NCAA Leadership Council. Locally he has served as president of the DeLand Rotary Club, vice-president of the DeLand Sports Redevelopment Association, and is a graduate of Leadership DeLand and Leadership Orlando. He is currently a member of the board of directors of the Central Florida Sports Commission. Altier was honored as the West Volusia Sportsperson of the Year for 2004. In 2011 Altier was recognized by his peers in the National Association of Collegiate Director of Athletics as the Under Armour Southeast Region Division I Athletic Director of the Year. Altier's family includes wife, Sarah (Booker) (Stetson B.A. `82, M.Ed. `96), and children Heath (Stetson M.B.A. `09), Brianne, and Garrett.\n\nJ e f f A L T I E R\nDirector of Athletics 16th Year\n\nwww.GoHatters.com\n\n27\n\n\u000CStetson Hatters Women's Soccer\n\nStetson Soccer Complex\n\nStetson President Dr. Wendy Libby announced that the University was brining football back for the first time since 1956 on March 14, 2011. More than a year later, on March 23, 2012, a groundbreaking ceremony for Stetson's $6.7 million field house and field renovation was held. The 25,000 square foot building on the corner of Minnesota and Amelia avenues houses locker rooms for men's and women's soccer, as well as the brand new football and lacrosse teams at Stetson. Additionally, state-ofthe-art sports medicine and strength and conditioning areas are also available to student-athletes at the Stetson University Athletics Training Facility. The facility also includes office and meeting room space for each of the four programs, as well as an equipment room. The VIP room on the second floor of the facility will double as a press box for home soccer and lacrosse games. On one side of the field house are practice fields for the football team, on the other side are game and practice fields for Stetson men's soccer, women's soccer, and lacrosse teams.\n\n@StetsonWSoccer\n\n28\n\n\u000CStetson Hatters Women's Soccer\n\nSports Medicine\n\uFFFD The Stetson University Sports Medicine staff is under the direction of the head team physician, three associate physicians, and full time certified athletic trainers providing a full complement of services to enhance the physical performance and personal healthcare of each student-athlete. \uFFFD The sports medicine staff's main location is in the athletic training room of the Wilson Athletic Center.

Ollie Edmunds Center has been home to Stetson men's basketball, women's basketball and volleyball contests. The Hatter men's basketball team defeated Marshall 73-58 in the inaugural Edmunds Center game on Dec. 5, 1974. In the 36 seasons since that time, the Hatters have amassed over 330 total victories in their home building. Maintaining a top-notch athletic facility is a continual process, and the work at the Edmunds Center has been at a pace to keep up with the development of the athletic program itself. Over the past several years, the Edmunds Center has received a number of physical modifications and equipment upgrades. The scoreboards, shot clocks, bench seating, illuminated media tables, floor design and lobby showcase have all recently been upgraded. In 2000, the maplewood floor was completely sanded and repainted, and new scoreboards were installed. In 2003, banners were hung in the Edmunds Center rafters for each member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. And in 2005, brand new bleachers were installed along the entire east end of the building. Eight modern locker rooms are housed in the Edmunds Center, among them the men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, softball and volleyball Edmunds Center locker rooms. The Edmunds Center houses coaches and staff offices. In addition, the complex contains the crew team workout facility, dressing rooms, the ticket office and an athletic training room. The Edmunds Center was home to the men's 1991 and 1996 Trans America Athletic Conference Tournaments as well as the women's tournament in 1997. It also served as training camp site for the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association in 1992 and 1993, and hosted the NCAA Volleyball Tournament First Round in 1996. Down the street is the Mandy Stoll Tennis Center, home of the Stetson men's and women's tennis programs. Located on the east-side of the DeLand campus, the Mandy Stoll Tennis Center was completed in late 1996. The state-ofthe-art facility is named in honor of Mandy Marie Stoll who was the tennis team's top player when she was killed in an automobile accident in April 1988 during her junior year. During her three years as a member of the Stetson tennis team, she set school records of 20 consecutive wins and 27 wins in one season. The facility includes six courts, with plans for six additional courts in the future, a kiosk, three gazebos, courtside bleachers and a new scoreboard. Three of the six courts have been named: one for Mary Estella Palmer McNamara, the late wife of SU trustee Dennis McNamara of Orlando and a Stetson graduate; one in honor of former Stetson tennis coach Vicky Pate, also a Stetson alumna; and one in memory of Mandy Stoll. The Mandy Stoll Tennis Center has served as the host location for four Atlantic Sun Conference Men's and Women's Tennis Championships. The Stetson softball team has played eight seasons on Patricia Wilson Field with tremendous success. The Hatters won their first 18 games on their home Mandy Stoll Tennis Center field in 2003 and have a combined home record of 240-92 (.723). The sparkling facility features spacious dugouts, multiple bullpen and batting cage areas, a state-of-the-art scoreboard, a brilliant lighting system for playing night games, and a concession area. Offices and a press box were built in 2007-08. In 2010 Stetson hosted the A-Sun Tournament for the fourth year in a row. One of the most picturesque, fan-friendly stadiums in the nation, Melching Field at Conrad Park will enter its 15th season as the home of Stetson Baseball in 2013. At a cost of $4.5 million, Melching Field was the result of a joint effort between Stetson University, DeLand Sports Redevelopment Association and the City of DeLand. Built on the same site as old Conrad Park, Melching Field opened on Feb. 12, 1999. Hatter fans have flocked to Melching Field in record numbers. With more than half a million fans since the stadium opened in 1999, Stetson is often ranked nationally among college baseball attendance leaders. Melching Field features permanent seating for 2,500 spectators with grass berms holding approximately 500 additional fans. A full-service concessions area greets visitors upon their entrance to the park on Woodland Boulevard. The 2012 season marked the debut of a new high-tech scoreboard, which is located in left field and is equipped with a state-of-the-art message center and graphics board. The numerous golf courses in Florida provide the men's and women's golf teams with ample places to play. The Hatters host tournaments every year at the DeLand Country Club, Southridge Golf Club, and Victoria Hills Golf Club. Also, the cross country teams host a meet every October at the Sperling Sports Complex, and the crew team practices and competes at nearby Lake Beresford.
