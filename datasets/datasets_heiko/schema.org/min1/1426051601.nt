All of those folks should be fired! This has come at the expense of characters with history who DESERVE to be on Days helluva lot more than those folks, like Marlena, John, Jack, Lucas, Carrie, and Austin. Why is Roman on contract when he\u2019s never used? Hell, why haven\u2019t they recast him with Wayne Northrop, the REAL Roman? Stefano used to be a truly frightening villain, so why has he been reduced to an organ-stealing diabetic?! Why are Lexie and Abe even together? They aren\u2019t a supercouple\u2014she\u2019s cheated on him multiple times and he\u2019s a verbally, emotionally, and borderline physically abusive creep. Why isn\u2019t Lexie a true DiMera villainess? The return of Carly has been a bust from the get-go. Justin and Adrienne essentially reunited in ONE EPISODE without any build-up or follow-up. Their original wedding is one of Days\u2019 highest-rated episodes ever, and their new, reunion wedding occurred off-screen! What is this show thinking?! To top it off, the series revolves around Sami Brady. It\u2019s sickening that the psycho who spent the 90s torturing her sister is now the lead heroine of Days. And the second lead female character of this show is Nicole, someone brought on as the love interest of a character who hasn\u2019t been on this show in over a DECADE!!! The show\u2019s leading man, EJ, is a joke. First of all, he was horribly SORASed which was bad enough. But then they pissed all over his mother Susan\u2019s infamous exit storyline and rewrote his backstory. This is extremely, terribly insulting because EJ is not even HALF the character his mother Susan Banks was!\n2) Writing\nDena Higley\u2019s writing is dreadful. Her stories lack humor and charm. They take themselves way too seriously. There is no sense of identity with this show\u2014it can\u2019t decide if it wants to be campy/sci-fi or traditional/character-driven. Days has pulled off a mixture of both over the years, but Higley lacks the finesse to make it flow together. Her stories aren\u2019t exciting. They\u2019re essentially previous stories rehashed with different characters. It\u2019s awful. There is no sense of fun, no sense of creativity, and certainly no sense of DRAMA. Where is the build-up? Where is the pay-off? Where is the imagination?\n3) Production Values\nDays has got to be the most horribly lit show on daytime. The actors all glow a disturbing purple or orange hue. The sets are WAAAAY too bright! Remember when the lighting used to be moody and atmospheric? Look at the Cheatin\u2019 Heart: it used to be a darkly-lit set (makes sense because it\u2019s a BAR), but now it glows a weird orange colour. And how in the f**k does it make sense for the pier and the park to be ONE SET?! NO! The pier and the park are two separate, distinct sets and always have been. \nI applaud Days for moving Suzanne Rogers to the front-burner\u2014she proved her acting chops to the new generation in \u201903 when Maggie was targeted and then seemingly murdered by the Salem Stalker. But even this is not without flaw\u2014Maggie\u2019s \u201Crelationship\u201D with Victor has come at the expense of Caroline, Victor\u2019s TRUE love, who has been utterly destroyed as a character to prop \u201CMagic\u201D. \nThe only other compliment I can give Days is for throwing Alice a decent memorial (although not perfect though several important characters were excluded), and for having Kate marry Stefano.\nI don\u2019t watch Days anymore and haven\u2019t in years, but I catch it from time to time. It\u2019s a sad shell of its former self. I used to love this show in the 90s and I wish I could watch it again, but as long as the show looks like crap, is written by a horrible head writer, and features characters I just plain don\u2019t like, I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tMay 2, 2011 at 10:05 pm\n\n\t\t\n\t\t#406404\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\talstonboy4315\n\t\t\n\t\t\t853 Posts\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tA-Crane,\nYou don\u2019t like Nicole?

And I haven\u2019t been feeling her 2008-present run at all. She is just one of those characters who really has NO ties to anyone on the canvas. \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tMay 3, 2011 at 1:44 am\n\n\t\t\n\t\t#406432\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\takbad806\n\t\t\n\t\t\t243 Posts\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tNicole and Chloe are both useless to me. DAYS would be so much better if it invested in someone like Sarah Buxton (ex-Annie, Sunset; ex-Morgan, B&B) to play Kristen Blake or Tom Phelphey to play Nicholas Alamain or one of Justin and Adrianne\u2019s boys. This show needs talent which it is sorely lacking. DAYS is like an afterthought and it\u2019s currently boring. Rarely has this soap surprised me since I started tuning back in.

But I did want to make a few comments. I think that Sami deserves to be a major player on Days. As it\u2019s heroine? Well maybe she might have stayed a little more villianous. However AW successfully transitioned Rachel from bitch to shows lead, and people DO change occasionally in real life too so I am not sure that I hate the idea of Sami being he leading lady as much as you do. (Although Jennifer would be more suited perhaps). I would love for Days to beef up the Hortons. There are so many of them and alot of them have been out of town for so long that they must have alot of stories by now. I think it would be better to build on the Horton family than to have to start all over with the Hernandez family which is just really a latino version of the Brady clan. And not even as charismatic as the original. All the Brady kids had some spark about them. The Hernandez\u2019s are pretty lack luster. Heck I like Fo Rafe better than the real one.\nThey could bring Doug and Julie back, give them a night club where people could hang out, and then layer in different Hortons. I would also eventually like to see Jack return with Jen.  \nAs far as story is concerned, I think making the daily episodes more interesting and compelling would be where I would start. It can be a real drudge to try to watch Days. Some of the actors are engaging and try to make the show interesting to watch but the sets are so bad, the dialog so repititious(lol even our complaints about this show are repititious because they never fix it), there is not enough interaction between different groups of people. You keep seeing the same characters over and over in scenes together. \nIf Gabi and Abbey are gonna be viable characters, the show needs to pair them up with some of the shows better actresses like they did with Molly to get their acting up to par. Plus get rid of their baby names and call them Abigail and Gabrielle. It is hard to believe them as adults in training calling them Gabi and Abbey\u2026.. Abigail could spend alot more time with her mom. Maybe pair Gabrielle up with Maggie or Sami. Or scrap the whole thing and just give us Chill, which is what we want anyway! Chad \u201Ccould\u201D be a straight character and I could see him with a girl but Will is so akward with girls, I am not sure I even believe he has a hetero gene in him. The chemistry is definately between them and not with their girlfriends.\nCut some losses. Daniel, Molly, Chloe, Carly, they could all dissapear and we would not notice.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tMay 5, 2011 at 4:47 am\n\n\t\t\n\t\t#406681\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tsodsince16\n\t\t\n\t\t\t33 Posts\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tIt\u2019s interesting that you write about the lack of characterization in Days because I think that consistency of characterization is one of this soap\u2019s strengths.  \nSometimes on soaps female characters seem to have no internal motivation for their actions.  They are simply mean or a victim or nuts.  For example, Madison on AMC \u2013 I have no idea who this woman is, she is defined by the terrible things that happen to her.  There are times when I cannot differentiate her from Marissa another totally undefined character.  I have no idea why she likes Scott, except for the fact that he is handsome and nice.\nHowever on Days, \u2013 although the plots are silly, and everyone seems to live in one of three houses despite being so wealthy that nobody goes to work on a daily basis \u2013 we know why the characters do what they do.  Sami was forever changed by Marlena\u2019s affair on the boardroom table.  EJ struggles between good and evil and question of whether being born a Dimera means that he has to act like a Dimera.  Nicole wants whatever she can\u2019t have because Fey didn\u2019t care for her as much as her siblings.  The motivations remain the same it\u2019s just the plots that change.\nSo \u2013 while I think that there are a lot of things that are wrong in Salem, and Alister\u2019s list was fairly comprehension \u2013 I don\u2019t think that character is one of them.  \nFinally, I think, soap fans have to stop looking backward in hopes of saving the soaps.  The return of Marlena is not going to suddenly turn Days into Gone with the Wind.  This type of thinking hasn\u2019t allowed any new soaps to flourish in the past decade and without new soaps or new characters there will be nothing left in the next decade.  Case in point, Melanie \u2013 a character who everyone hated when she first came on, but with some further development Melanie could easily drive story for the next ten years and it would keep me interested.  I am trying to be positive about new families and new characters in the hopes that one will stick and move the story forward.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tMay 5, 2011 at 5:08 am\n\n\t\t\n\t\t#406688\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tAnonymous\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2899 Posts\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tMarlena\u2019s presence may not save Days from cancellation but she certainly deserves to be on this show a HELLUVA lot more than the disgusting Melanie! GMAFB. The idea of \u201Cgoing forward\u201D is not going to save Days. That\u2019s a fallacy. ALL of the four remaining soaps have an expiration date. The best thing to do is reward the LOYAL fans who love characters like Marlena, John, Jack, and Lucas and bring them back to the show and write good stories for them. Teenagers aren\u2019t suddenly going to start soaps and save them. \nAlso, I never said anything was wrong with Days\u2019 characterization. I said it\u2019s a show full of characters who shouldn\u2019t be on it, and it\u2019s a show that centres around the wrong characters. \nWith characters like Melanie and Rafe eating up the show, Days has lots its identity. True Days characters like Marlena, John, Jack, Carrie, etc. can restore Days\u2019 sense of identity and make this show RECOGNIZABLE and worth watching again.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\tMay 5, 2011 at 7:41 pm\n\n\t\t\n\t\t#406817\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tdavid46208\n\t\t\n\t\t\t826 Posts\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tIn addition is when you got the fabulous actors like Renee Jones and James Reynolds (Lexie and Abe) running chasing kids literally.
