However, after many complaints from folks who would understandably like to stay on the subject, I am providing this post as a place to comment things that are\u00A0way off topic with the current post. \n\nI\u2019ve added a link to this post on our sidebar so people will know to post off topic comments here. \n\nYou now have the option of subscribing to posts, so you\u2019ll be able to keep up with the comments here if you so choose. So it\u2019s not as if your comment is being exiled to the land of forgotten comments. We\u2019ll be paying attention, and you can stay up to date with an RSS feed. \n\nAs much as we\u2019d like to hear about your synchronized swimming club, I ask that all comments posted here remain TSA focused and adhere to TSA\u2019s comment policy. \n\nBlogger Bob\nTSA Blog Team\n\n" .
