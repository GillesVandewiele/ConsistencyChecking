Heck, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these guys turned out to be the real-life version of The Expendables.\nNot surprisingly, the Twittersphere was on top of it.\nOne fan pointed out an officer\u2019s uncanny resemblance to a popular \u201890s mascot:\n\nWhy Les Miles got smokey the bear for his security guard pic.twitter.com/M8ATcCHsH2\n\u2014 Mr. Baker \uFE3B\u2566\u2564\u2500 (@Cir_Rock6) November 10, 2013\n\nGiven the overall size and build of the security detail, the Florida Times-Union\u2019s Ryan O\u2019Halloran\u00A0tweeted about the potential interest from the Jacksonville Jaguars:\n\nThe #jaguars are signing one of Les Miles' security guards to play left guard tomorrow.\n\u2014 Ryan O'Halloran (@ryanohalloran) November 10, 2013\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest, even they wouldn\u2019t be able to do enough to make Blaine Gabbert\u00A0look like an NFL quarterback.\nOthers even compared the size of Miles\u2019 entourage to that of popular political figures:\n\nDoes Les Miles have as much security as Governor Jindal? #geauxtigers\n\u2014 David Patterson (@ibdp3) November 10, 2013\n\n\nLes Miles has more security than President Obama.\n\u2014 Pat White (@PatWhiteSports) November 10, 2013\n\nWho knows? Maybe the 59-year-old is preparing himself for a career in politics?\nThen again, it\u2019s most likely any potential political opponent would tear him apart for his colorful language and ignorance of common traffic laws. Not to mention, I\u2019m sure eating grass wouldn\u2019t really fly with the undecided voters either.\nWhatever the case, it all made up for one intimidating line of defense for Miles.\nThat's something he didn\u2019t get from his Tigers in Saturday\u2019s 38-17 loss to Alabama. A game in which LSU\u2019s defense was picked apart for nearly 400 yards of total offense\u2014including 193 yards on the ground.\nBut while it\u2019s safe to say Miles won\u2019t be entering his 60th birthday (Nov. 10) in a good mood, there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll be well protected.\n\u00A0\nFor complete coverage and everything college football, you can reach Sebastian on Facebook, on Twitter and via e-mail at Sebastian.LenaBR@gmail.com\n\n            "@en .
