Will the offensive line prevent opposing teams from creating a breach?\u00A0Will quarterbacks cower in fear to the names of Dion Jordan, Oliver Vernon and Cameron Wake? If used correctly, the three of them hope to make even Tom Brady's knees shiver and quake.\u00A0\nLet's move on from the disappointment of our roundball boys' season's end. Follow along and read about some Dolphins buzz, my aqua and orange friend.\u00A0\n            "@en .

Per\u00A0The Sun-Sentinel's Chris Perkins,\u00A0here's what Joe Philbin had to say:\u00A0\n\nWe don't really have starters right now. We're not overly concerned about that. We're teaching a system and a style of play offensively, so exactly who is getting what plays at this stage of the game isn't really the focus.\nBut [Miller is] a little bit bigger than he was a year ago, he's moving very well.\n\nPardon him for not participating in the rhymes, for as a head coach, he doesn't have the time.\u00A0\nA third-year leap for the former 'Cane Miller would, however, be sublime.\u00A0\nMoreno knew he'd have to work for the position and its responsibilities. Adam H. Beasley of the\u00A0Miami Herald reports on Moreno and\u00A0how the former Bronco feels physically:\u00A0\n\nI\u2019m definitely not there. This is just the beginning. It\u2019s just the beginning, getting your feet wet, and when you have time off, working at those little things, getting back to where you need to be, and once camp comes, it\u2019ll be good.\n\nThe battle of backs in Miami is set and will last straight through July. If I definitively told you the battle's victory, I would be engaging in a lie.\u00A0\n            "@en .

Here's his quotes from ESPN's James Walker, on what Wallace thinks it will mean:\u00A0\n\nNobody can ever key on me. Last year, you kind of knew where I was every single play, what you had to do because I was there every game, same spot. Moving around, it\u2019s harder for the defense to know where you\u2019re at, harder for them to adjust.\u00A0\n\nNot utilizing Wallace and his versatility got both the fans and myself frustrated at former offensive coordinator Mike Sherman's West Coast scheme.\u00A0\nWill there be a change under Bill\u00A0Lazor? That certainly seems to be, for an explosive Wallace makes for an explosive offense, and a slightly more productive one in the least.\u00A0\n            "@en .

He can expect more attention from the defenses every time he goes out to play.\u00A0\nClay is ready for what will happen as he lines up on the field, telling\u00A0The Sun-Sentinel's\u00A0Chris Perkins exactly what he'll do to deal.\u00A0\n\"It'll be tough,\" Clay said to Mr. Perkins, which at first doesn't sound too soothing, but then he added,\u00A0\"I've got just come out and keep working, trying to get better every day, just keep improving.\"\u00A0\nClay continued to add to his statement and would say without a scowl, \"But it won't be easy, obviously. People know now.\"\nClay's an integral part of the offense and will be used quite frequently.

Gimenez would not confirm the exact amount the team would receive for a Super Bowl but said: 'You\u2019re pretty close but I\u2019m not going to say what that is because we haven\u2019t finalized those negotiations yet, but they are pretty close to being final.'\nThere would also be set payments for other events such as a college football championship, international soccer tournaments, and other major events.\n\nThe deal is not final yet, as Mayor Gimenez still must take it to the county commission, but due to the specs I see, I don't see why they wouldn't give it their permission.\u00A0\n\u00A0\nStatistics come from Pro-Football-Reference, my choice for stats and NFL history.
