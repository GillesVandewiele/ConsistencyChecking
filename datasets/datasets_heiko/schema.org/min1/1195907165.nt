Both letters called upon the United States to veto any resolution in the UN Security Council criticizing the Israeli attack.\nWhat is perhaps most disturbing is that many of the key arguments in the letters were misleading and, in some cases, factually inaccurate. \nThe Israeli government had acknowledged prior to the writing of the letter that the extensive blockade of humanitarian goods was not necessary for their security, but as a means of pressuring the civilian population to end their support for Hamas, which won a majority of legislative seats in the most recent Palestinian election. In addition, the Israeli government announced a significant relaxation of the embargo two days after the letter was written. Despite this, the House letter claimed that the purpose of the blockade was \u201Cto stop terrorists from smuggling weapons to kill innocent civilians,\u201D thereby placing this large bipartisan majority of the House even further to the right than Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightist coalition. \nThere was no mention in the letter than no such weapons were found on board any of the six ships hijacked by the Israelis nor on the previous eight ships the Free Gaza Campaign had sailed or attempted to sail to the Gaza Strip. In addition, even though the ships had been thoroughly inspected by customs officials prior to their disembarkation, the House letter claimed that had the Israelis not hijacked the ships, they would have \u201Csailed unchecked into Gaza.\u201D\nSimilarly, according to the Senate letter, Israel\u2019s naval blockade was necessary \u201Cto keep dangerous goods from entering Gaza by sea\u201D and falsely claimed that the intent of the Israeli blockade was \u201Cto protect Israel, while allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.\u201D Particularly striking is the fact that, despite that the International Committee on the Red Cross and a broad consensus of international legal experts recognize that the Israeli blockade of humanitarian goods is illegal, the Senate letter insisted that the blockade \u201Cis legal under international law.\u201D\nThe House letter insisted, despite the fact that several of those killed on the Mavi Marmara were shot at point blank range in the back or the back of the head and a video showing a 19-year old U.S. citizen shot execution style on the ground, that \u201CIsraeli forces used necessary force as an act of self-defense and of last resort.\u201D Similarly, the Senate letter refers to the murders of passengers and crew resisting the illegal boarding of their vessel in international waters as a situation where the Israeli raiders were \u201Cforced to respond to that attack\u201D when they \u201Carrived\u201D on the ship. \nThe House letter also claimed that the other ships were \u201Ccommandeered peacefully and without incident,\u201D even though on the other ships, despite completely nonviolent resistance, passengers were tasered and brutally beaten and were attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets. Similarly, the Senate letter insisted that, in spite of these potentially fatal beatings and other assaults, \u201CIsraeli forces were able to safely divert five of the six ships challenging the blockade.\u201D\nEven though the Israeli government has never entered Gaza to disperse aid to the people of that territory since the start of the siege years earlier and reputable relief organizations have documented that the Israelis had routinely refused to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip, these House members claimed that Israel had offered to \u201Cdisperse the aid . . . directly to the people of Gaza.\u201D And, despite the fact that the five aid ships that Israel had allowed to dock in Gaza in previous months had distributed their humanitarian cargo directly to those in need, the senators claimed that it would have otherwise gone \u201Cinto the hands of corrupt Gaza officials.\u201D\nLearning what actually transpired in the tragic incident was apparently of little interest to the 87 senators who signed the letter defending the attack. Despite the apparent whitewash forthcoming in the internal Israeli investigation, the senate letter supported Israel\u2019s alleged intention to carry out \u201Ca thorough investigation of the incident,\u201D insisting that Israel \u201Chas the right to determine how its investigation is conducted.\u201D This comes in spite of a recent public opinion poll shows a clear majority of Americans \u2014 including 65 percent of Democrats \u2014 favor an international inquiry over allowing Israel alone to investigate the circumstances of the attack . \nIronically, a number of progressive organizations, web sites and list serves have called on the peace and human rights community to support the re- election of some of the very senators who signed this letter, including Barbara Boxer, Ron Wyden, and Russell Feingold. MoveOn, Council for a Livable World, and other progressive groups with PAC money have been are calling on their members, many of whom are peace and human rights activists, to donate their money to these right-wing Democrats who defend attacking peace and human rights activists and lie about the circumstances to justify it. They have no problems with supporting the re-election of those who lie and mislead their constituents in order to defend illegal actions by allied right-wing governments, even when they kill and injure participants in a humanitarian flotilla on the high seas.\nThere may be an underlying current of racism at work here. It is unlikely MoveOn, Council for a Livable World and other groups would defend such actions if, for example, if the activists were helping those under siege in Sarajevo in the 1990s or West Berlin in the 1940s, who happened to be white Europeans.\nIt is important to remember that the majority of Democrats joined in with Republicans in supporting the Salvadoran junta in the early 1980s and the Suharto regime in the 1990s until voters made clear they would withdraw their support from them if they did not change their policy. AIPAC and other right-wing \u201Cpro-Israel\u201D groups are only as powerful as the absence of counter-pressure from the peace and human rights community. Letters like these will continue to be supported by most Democrats only as long they know they can get away with it.\n\n"@en-us .
