Jones? It was the January 2012 case in which the US Supreme Court decided unanimously that law enforcement does not have the right to warrantlessly put a GPS tracking device on a suspect\u2019s car. (In the wake of that decision, the FBI turned off 3,000 such tracking devices.)\nWhile the Supreme Court ruled on that important element of the case\u2014reversing the plaintiff's life sentence on federal drug charges\u2014the case (minus the invalidated GPS evidence and everything stemming from it) was sent back down to a lower court to be re-tried.\nIn addition to GPS tracking, federal prosecutors asked for (and obtained) court-ordered access to Antoine Jones' cell-site data in 2005. Late this year, Jones\u2019 attorneys filed a motion to have that location and behavioral data suppressed during a recent pretrial proceeding, citing the precedent Jones set with his Supreme Court hearing.\nLast Friday, the judge on the case denied that motion (PDF), siding with federal prosecutors and saying the agents involved were operating in \u201Cgood faith.\u201D\n\"Because at the time of the applications in this case it was reasonable for the officers to seek an order authorizing the disclosure of cell-site data, it was also reasonable for them to rely on the magistrate judges\u2019 orders granting those applications,\" Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle wrote, citing legal precedent for this line of reasoning.\nThat decision falls generally in line with many other court orders validating law enforcement\u2019s investigative power to surveil and monitor criminal suspects, even if the police can't put a physical device on a car. Such court orders\u2014which can include what\u2019s called a \u201C(d) order,\u201D or a pen register\u2014require a judge\u2019s approval, but not a warrant. These court orders of a lower legal standard likely gave investigators information about who Jones called, when, and where he was when he did so.\nAs we\u2019ve reported before, other types of high-tech surveillance and monitoring continue being used by law enforcement on a daily basis around the country. Cops are using everything from tap and trace,\u00A0ping data,\u00A0license plate surveillance, and other techniques as a way to keep tabs on suspects and innocent citizens without going through the threshold of a judicially reviewed probable-cause-driven warrant. Historically, judges and courts have been reluctant to halt or slow such requests, but there have been some exceptions in recent years.\nStill, the judge presiding over the Jones case, Judge Huvelle, declined to rule on the over-arching question that we all want to know: does the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, require that cops get a warrant if they want to track us by any means? Or can our cellphones be used against us as tracking devices?\n\u201CThe Court, however, need not resolve this vexing question of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, since it concludes that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies,\u201D she wrote.\nPrivacy experts hoped this would continue to raise broader questions about the boundaries between law enforcement and digital privacy, though.\n\u201CIn the grand scheme of things, this case is not that big of a deal,\u201D Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Ars. \u201CIt's saying that in 2005, the law was unsettled and [the judge said] \u2018I'm not going to find their conduct unreasonable and because of that I'm not going to touch the legal issue as to whether people have a legal expectation of privacy even though they turned them over to the provider.\u2019\u201D\nReasonable expectations of privacy in the digital age\nThe judge here cited the \u201Cthird-party doctrine,\" which is the\u00A0idea that individuals have no \u201Creasonable expectation of privacy\u201D when they give up information with a company or government agency.\nIn this case, any cellphone user has to give up his or her location to the mobile phone company so they can be provided with service. The logic goes that because an individual has given up that location information to the company, it therefore cannot be considered private in the first place.\n\u201CThere's a ton of questions left unanswered,\u201D Fakhoury added. \u201CIt's coming up on the one-year anniversary [of Jones] and it's a good time to reflect and think about what's happened [privacy-wise], and the reality is, not much.\u201D\nWhile this new opinion in the Jones case may be disappointing for privacy advocates including the EFF, which wrote an amicus brief for Jones in the case, there may be a chance for courts to more fully evaluate digital privacy in the future.\nAfter all, in the Supreme Court decision (PDF) Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote her concurring opinion that the entire third-party doctrine may need to be reconsidered.\n\u201CI would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into account when considering the existence of a reasonable societal expectation of privacy in the sum of one\u2019s public movements,\u201D she wrote. \u201CI would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on.\u201D\n\u201CThis approach is ill-suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks,\u201D she concluded.\n    \t\t"@en-us .
